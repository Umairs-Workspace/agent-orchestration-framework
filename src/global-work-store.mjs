// second read/parse of the record docs. One argument, the same row shape, sourced from the

// never the disease; the wholesale delete-and-rebuild wrapped around it was.

// rebuilt the table from scratch, and decides whether rows are DELETED now that it does not:
//   `authoritative` — false when the work stream itself could not be read (a missing or
//                     unreadable work dir). listItems answers a missing directory with an
//                     empty list, which read as "every item was deleted" and would retract
//                     the node's entire slice on a transient fault.
//   `errors[].ref`  — the ref of the item whose record doc failed, so a publish can keep
//                     claiming it. An unparseable frontmatter is a read fault, not a
