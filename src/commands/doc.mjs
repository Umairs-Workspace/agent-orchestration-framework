// work:doc — read an item's record doc (was board-ui.mjs handleDoc; ADR-002/003).
//
// A READ command: resolves the ref with `resolveItem` (exact-preferred, free-text
// slug fallback tolerated). An unknown doc NAME is an input-contract failure
// (invalid-doc → 400). An unresolved ref is ref-not-found → 404. A doc that
// exists is returned with `present:true` and its verbatim body; a missing file is
// absent-NOT-error — `{ present:false, body:"" }` (today's ENOENT path), not a
// thrown error. The echoed `doc` is the UPPERCASE doc name.
//
// schema v5 (TECH_DEBT item 6 — finish the board bridge): a ref/doc the LOCAL
// checkout cannot answer falls back to the worker-streamed projection (the SAME
// path the item rows already ride — cache-read.mjs) before 404/absent. A
// mesh item's streamed story used to dead-end here ("No item resolves to ref
// \"18/03\"") even while the board was listing it; the fallback answers with the
// worker's own body, marked `fromWorker` + `reportedBy` so the surface can say
// whose view it is. Local disk still wins whenever it can answer.
