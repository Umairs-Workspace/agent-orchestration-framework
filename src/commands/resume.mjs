// work:resume — the deterministic re-entry point after a run was killed by infra
// (348 auto-resume).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. When an API session limit kills the orchestrator, aof cannot
// restart it: the orchestrator IS the Claude Code session, and this CLI is a child
// of the thing that died. What aof CAN remove is the cost of coming back — measured
// on vista-app 348, three kills cost 6h18m of dead run, and each restart then spent
// ten to twenty minutes with the orchestrator re-deriving state it had already
// established (worse, once: it re-authored a killed architect's work by hand instead
// of resuming its lineage, discarding a completed run).
//
// So this verb answers ONE question completely: **what should resume, and is it
// ready?** A sweep (no ref) reports every retryable failed run in the stream with
// its readiness; a ref RESUMES that item's lineage. It re-derives nothing — the
// classification, the ceiling and the park gate are all the run store's
// (retryReadiness), and the mint is the same transition run-retry uses. Two faces,
// one authority.
//
// It NEVER resumes work it cannot execute. A resumed run record means "an executor
// is on this"; minting one with nothing behind it would make the record lie, which
// is strictly worse than the failure it replaces. The sweep therefore REPORTS ready
// local runs (the caller re-enters) and only ACTS when asked for a ref.
//
// WHY IT IS REGISTERED — the comment that stood above this module's entry in `src/command-core.mjs`,
// moved here unedited (119/02, FF-11908: the registry cites, it does not explain).
//
//   348 auto-resume — the deterministic re-entry face over the SAME retry authority.
