// work:run-complete — the terminal transition running→outcome on a run (ADR-001/003),
// PORTED to the effects ledger (m42 wave (d) leg d2 — the first cascade off the
// inline pattern). The run ORDER is load-bearing: (1) validate the outcome
// against the closed set done|failed|cancelled BEFORE resolving anything;
// (2) resolve the target EXACT (resolveItemExact — a typo never completes a run
// on the wrong item); (3) hand the terminal edge to transitionRunComplete — the
// run store's ONLY event-raiser — which writes the fact, appends `run.completed`
// to the per-node journal, and drains the event's local-locus reactors
// synchronously before returning.
//
// The CASCADE THIS FILE USED TO REMEMBER INLINE (20/ADR-005 status rollback +
// publish-on-mutate) now lives DECLARED in src/effects/table.mjs's "run.completed"
// entry — this command can no longer forget it, and neither can the other
// completeRun call sites as they port (the wave-(d) migration plan's d2 sweep).
// A reactor failure is a failed journal step + degrade event (retried by later
// drains), never a silent skip and never a lost completion.
