// graph:serve — the stdio MCP server as a REGISTERED launcher-seam command (m42
// wave (d) leg d1, wave-3 tail; formerly cli.mjs's CLI-only graphServeCommand
// ladder branch). `aof graph serve` launches the line-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0
// server the story-02 rendered MCP config entry targets (command:"aof",
// args:["graph","serve"] — story 04, ADR-005 amendment). It is a thin transport
// face over the SAME command core — it reaches the graph ONLY through
// invoke("graph:…"), and spawns no graphify itself (the driver src/graphify.mjs
// is the sole spawn site — ADR-006 inv. 2).
//
// The launcher seam splits its two faces:
//   run (the probe) — mcpServeProbe: the MCP server identity + protocol + the
//     advertised tool descriptors, non-blocking. This is the --json face (the
//     face's probe rule: --json never launches), which keeps the
//     acd-graph-command-cli-bijection spawn probe from hanging on the stdio loop.
//   cli.launch — the long-lived serveStdio body: loadWorkspace resolves the ctx
//     the server's tool handlers pass to invoke; the server then speaks JSON-RPC
//     over stdin/stdout until EOF.
//
// WHY IT IS REGISTERED — the comment that stood above this module's entry in `src/command-core.mjs`,
// moved here unedited (119/02, FF-11908: the registry cites, it does not explain).
//
//   m42 wave (d) leg d1 (wave-3 tail, part 2 continued) — the remaining launcher
//   verbs onto the SAME seam: graph:serve (the stdio MCP server), work:ui (the
//   board), assets:ui (the setup-UI editor + its dev-only vite re-exec). Each is a
//   probe run + a cli.launch body; their cli.mjs ladder branches are deleted.
