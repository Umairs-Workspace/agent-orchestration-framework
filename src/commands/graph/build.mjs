// Backend classification (RESEARCH §F). A NETWORK backend reaches a remote API

// field: egress reports whether the doc/media HOP ran, regardless of locality
// (ADR-005).
//
// `claude-cli` is graphify's native credential-local default (10/ADR-003): it
// shells the user's logged-in `claude -p` (no metered ANTHROPIC_API_KEY; billed to
// the plan). It is registered here BY KNOWLEDGE so the classification is by
// enumeration, not by the unknown-name network fall-through: billed-to-plan is
// orthogonal to egress — the prose IS still sent to Anthropic for inference, so it
// DOES cross the network (isNetworkBackend === true). It is NOT data-local; `ollama`
// remains the ONLY data-resident (on-box) backend. Both still egress "docs-media"
// (the doc/media hop ran) — locality is a separate privacy property (ADR-005).

// accident. An UNKNOWN name still falls closed to NETWORK (an unrecognised backend
