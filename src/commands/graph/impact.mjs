// graph:impact — the DETERMINISTIC, file-anchored coupling lookup the running ACD
// agents consume (milestone 11, re-open / ADR-007). Where `graph:query` is a fuzzy,
// similarity-seeded NL traversal (legible but unreliable — it seeds on doc nodes and
// needs re-phrasing), `graph:impact` answers the one question a reviewing/refining
// agent actually has, EXACTLY: "for these files, what do they import/call
// (dependencies) and what imports/calls them (dependents / blast-radius)?" — computed
// straight from the graph EDGES, no LLM, no spawn, no fuzz.
//
//   input  { paths: string[] }            // the files the agent is reviewing/changing
//   result ImpactResult { graphPath, builtAt,
//                         files: [{ file, present, dependencies[], dependents[] }] }
//
// `builtAt` is the ARTIFACT's mtime, and `present` says whether the graph covers the
// file at all — so a zero answer can be read for what it is. "Absent from the graph"
// (a coverage gap) and "in the graph with no cross-file edges" (real isolation) are
// distinct facts, and the human render states which one it is; conflating them let a
// failed build be recorded as the architectural finding "these modules have no coupling".
//
// It reads the STRUCTURED graph.json via the pure `normalizeGraph` (09/ADR-001's
// PERMITTED structured handle — the SAME read 10's memory backend uses), NOT the
// forbidden opaque markdown stdout. It is NOT a graphify spawn (graph.json is a file
// read; 09/ADR-002) — so it adds NO new spawn site. ADVISORY: it returns coupling
// FACTS the agent reasons over; it feeds no gate/merge (ADR-004 still holds).
//
// PRECONDITION (ADR-001, @executable): a graph must be built first. If
// <projectRoot>/graphify-out/graph.json is absent, `run` throws a build-first
// "no-graph" error BEFORE any read — deterministically CI-checkable, no binary needed.
//
// WHY IT IS REGISTERED — the comment that stood above this module's entry in `src/command-core.mjs`,
// moved here unedited (119/02, FF-11908: the registry cites, it does not explain).
//
//   milestone 11 (re-open / ADR-007) — graph:impact: the DETERMINISTIC, edge-based,
//   file-anchored coupling lookup the running ACD agents consume (dependencies +
//   dependents straight from graph.json's edges). Reads the structured graph via the
//   pure normalizer (NOT a spawn, NOT a markdown parse) — supersedes the milestone's
//   original ADR-002 "zero production code" stance, which left it with no real consumer.
