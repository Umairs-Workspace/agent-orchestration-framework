// work:upgrade — the CLI face over the migration registry engine
// (src/work/upgrade.mjs, milestone 40 / story 02, ADR-005). A thin wrapper —
// mirrors migrate:folder / insert-milestone's argv -> input -> engine shape.
//
// Bare `aof upgrade` APPLIES (writes through the ADR-004 atomic writer);
// `--dry-run` PREVIEWS and writes nothing — the `aof project migrate`
// dry-run/apply face precedent (bare = apply, `--dry-run` = preview only). A
// schema newer than this build REFUSES the whole run (a thrown command error,
// non-zero exit at the CLI face, nothing written).
//
// `--changelog` (milestone 40 / story 04, ADR-006) is the changelog's
// regenerate/drift-guard SURFACE: it emits `renderChangelog()` — the pure
// projection of `WORK_ITEM_MIGRATIONS` — to stdout and touches NO workspace
// state (no fs read of the committed artifact, no write). A maintainer (or
// CI) diffs the emitted text against the committed `UPGRADE-CHANGELOG.md` to
// confirm regenerate == committed, or pipes it straight over the file to
// regenerate. Takes precedence over `--dry-run`/apply — it never runs the
// engine.
//
// WHY IT IS REGISTERED — the comment that stood above this module's entry in `src/command-core.mjs`,
// moved here unedited (119/02, FF-11908: the registry cites, it does not explain).
//
//   milestone 40 / story 02 (migration registry & `aof upgrade`, ADR-005) —
//   work:upgrade registers into the SAME core. A thin wrapper over the NEW
//   src/work/upgrade.mjs engine (WORK_ITEM_MIGRATIONS + planUpgrade/runUpgrade),
//   which imports work.mjs's readers + the ADR-004 writer but is never imported
//   BY work.mjs (acd-upgrade-engine-blast-radius — the god-node's blast radius
//   does not grow). Reachable as the top-level `aof upgrade` verb (mirroring
//   `aof migrate` -> migrate:folder) AND as `aof work upgrade` (cli.mjs's
//   workCommand dispatch) — both routes reach this ONE registered command.
//   CLI-only by design (no board affordance requested — the same BOARD_DEFERRED
//   carve-out `insert-milestone`/`insert-chore`/etc already use).
