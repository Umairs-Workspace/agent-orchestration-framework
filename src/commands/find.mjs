// work:find — resolve a milestone (04), story (04/02), or slug (auth) to its
// work-stream rows (m42 wave (d) leg d1, wave-3 tail; formerly cli.mjs's
// CLI-only workFindCommand). A READ over the ONE resolver (work.mjs findWork),
// routed through the registry-derived route table + the generic face.
//
// Carried contracts (the retired face's bytes): the --json document is the BARE
// ARRAY of rows with cwd-relativised dirs (not an object envelope — pinned
// consumer shape); a no-match run prints `No work item matches "<q>".` on
// STDOUT and exits 1 (a read-miss, not an error) — but --json stays exit 0 with
// `[]` (the machine face reports the empty set, the caller branches).
//
// WHY IT IS REGISTERED — the comment that stood above this module's entry in `src/command-core.mjs`,
// moved here unedited (119/02, FF-11908: the registry cites, it does not explain).
//
//   m42 wave (d) leg d1 (wave-3 tail, the CLI-only batch) — the low-priority
//   CLI-only work verbs join the registry as routed Commands: work:find (the
//   resolver read), work:observe (the transcript miner), the headroom toggle
//   pair. Their cli.mjs faces are deleted; project:provision (below, m12) gained
//   its route in the same change (class B — its face copy is deleted too).

// it. Every returned row now says which side answered it.
