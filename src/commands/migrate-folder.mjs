//   migrate → CONVERTS a folder INTO managed work in the stream — a real, numbered
//             milestone SPEC.md (+ STATE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, stories/tasks) under
//             work.dir that resolves via `aof work find` and passes `aof work

// (resolveImportSource → isLocalSource, the offline @executable lane) and recovers
// it with the SAME recovery (recoverMilestone, including the arbitrary-source lane:
// README→intent, docs/ADRs→decisions, history→outcomes). It NEVER mutates or moves
// the source (the story-03 read-only arch-test). It then SCAFFOLDS a fresh managed
// milestone under work.dir at the NEXT FREE top-level slot — the architect's
// scaffold-not-relocate call (STORY.md Notes). A --dry-run PREVIEWS the scaffold
// (ref + dir + counts) and writes NOTHING (import's preview discipline).
//
// Four migrate-NEW seams over what import/recovery give for free (STORY.md
// feasibility notes), each implemented here:
//   - EMPTY-SOURCE REFUSAL: recovery returns an all-empty shape rather than
//     throwing, so migrate adds its own refusal (nothing-recoverable) — non-zero,
//     nothing written (file 03 "empty source refused cleanly").
//   - `done`-CLAMP: a source's self-asserted "done" is clamped to at most
//     in-review — migrate NEVER stamps "done" (earned only via aof:verify; file 02).
//   - FINDINGS + GAP-DETECTION: when delivered work has gaps, write
//     developer-actionable findings into the produced STATE.md `## Findings` (file
//     02). No delivered work → no findings (absence is information, never invented).
//   - STATUS reflecting reality: no work → not-started; delivered-with-gaps →
//     in-progress; fully delivered, clean → in-review (the honest ceiling).
//
// WHY IT IS REGISTERED — the comment that stood above this module's entry in `src/command-core.mjs`,
// moved here unedited (119/02, FF-11908: the registry cites, it does not explain).
//
//   story 29 — migrate-command (migrate:folder registers into the SAME core). The
//   CONTRAST with import:milestone: import SUMMARISES a foreign folder into a
//   read-only AOF.md digest; migrate CONVERTS it INTO a managed milestone under
//   work.dir (refinable/continuable/verifiable). It reuses import's read-only
//   source-access + recovery seam, then SCAFFOLDS a native managed milestone at the
//   next free slot. Takes the `migrate:` prefix, so it is EXCLUDED from the
//   `work:`-filtered bijection but inherits the generic command-cli bijection.
