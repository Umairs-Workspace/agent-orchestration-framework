// mesh:heartbeat — the one-shot presence PUBLISH command (milestone 23 / story 00,
// ADR-002; the relay push RETIRED milestone 33 / story 01, ADR-002.1). Thin over
// src/mesh/presence.mjs (the record assembly + the activeRuns read of the run records +
// the atomic publish via the m22-reserved presenceRecordPath) and the node-identity id
// resolution (src/node-identity.mjs + mesh-identity's salt/version idiom), carrying the
// frozen { id, input, run, cli } contract (08/ADR-002).
//
//   mesh:heartbeat — assemble THIS node's presence record (its stable nodeId, the
//                    heartbeat instant, its in-flight run ids READ from the run records,
//                    its aof version) and PUBLISH it to git — the durable floor (a
//                    republish bumps heartbeatAt; nodeId is stable; a peer's record is
//                    untouched).
//
// THE RELAY PUSH IS RETIRED (milestone 33 / story 01, ADR-002.1 — F-3204): the ws@8
// broker is eliminated as the presence/liveness transport; the fabric peer-map
// (src/mesh/fabric.mjs's resolvePeers) is the fast liveness read now, consumed by
// mesh:status (src/commands/mesh-identity.mjs), not pushed here. This command performs
// ONLY the git write — UNCONDITIONAL, the durable floor (story 00) — with NO relay
// push side and NO createRelayClient/pushPresenceSignal import.
//
// It writes ONLY through the presence seam (presenceRecordPath/meshDir) via the atomic
// writeText seam, and references ZERO record-doc filename (the write-scope guard, fitness
// #3 / acd-presence-write-scope — story 00's, untouched). The activeRuns read is a READ
// of the run records — it mutates no run record.
//
// WHY IT IS REGISTERED — the comment that stood above this module's entry in `src/command-core.mjs`,
// moved here unedited (119/02, FF-11908: the registry cites, it does not explain).
//
//   milestone 23 — control-node-relay (story 00: presence-heartbeat — mesh:heartbeat
//   registers into the SAME core; ADR-002). Thin over story 00's src/mesh/presence.mjs
//   (the presence-record assembly + the activeRuns read of the run records + the atomic
//   publish via the m22-reserved presenceRecordPath); it publishes THIS node's presence
//   git-only (no relay — story 02 adds the push). mesh:status is EXTENDED in place
//   (mesh-identity.mjs) to render presence + the stale flag. Additive — one import + one
//   COMMANDS entry. It takes the `mesh:` prefix, so it is EXCLUDED from the
//   `work:`-filtered bijection but RIDES the existing acd-mesh-command-cli-bijection gate
//   (now covering identity+status+sync+heartbeat).
import os from "node:os";
// m43 / story 06 (ADR-005) — a STAGE-2 LEAF. The item enumeration is cache-first, so the
// heartbeat's run read considers every item the mesh knows about rather than only the ones
// this checkout happens to hold. What it must NOT do is advertise another node's run as its
// own: `activeRuns` is "the OWNER node's synced presence.activeRuns … the only fleet-durable
// run signal" (mesh-identity.mjs, m38 finding F1), so the RECORDS still come from run files
// on this node's disk, and a cache-known ref with no local checkout is SKIPPED and reported
// (ADR-010/R6.4) rather than having a run invented for it.
