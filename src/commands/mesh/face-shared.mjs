// The mesh family's shared CLI-face vocabulary (m42 wave (d) leg d1, wave 3) —
// what meshVerbCli owned before the registered mesh verbs moved onto the
// registry-derived route table + the ONE generic face (src/spine/face.mjs).
// Three pieces, each now declared per-command instead of hand-kept in cli.mjs:
//   - the `--workspace` flag every mesh verb accepts (the face resolves it);
//   - the positional discipline (no stray id / at most one id / no empty id),
//     thrown from the argv adapter so the face's envelope discipline applies;
//   - the read-miss split (a supplied ref resolving to null is a FACE-level
//     node-not-found; the command's null return stays a command-level absent).

// `--workspace <path|id>` — the cwd-independent target selector (m42 wave (b)
// item 4): a path loads that workspace; a bare id resolves its registered
// projectRoot through the global descriptor store. Resolution lives in the
// generic face (resolveWorkspaceRoot); declaring the flag here is what admits it
// past spec-parse.
