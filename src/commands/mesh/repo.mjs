// `aof mesh repo publish` — the explicit "publish THIS repo into the mesh" verb
// (milestone 34 / story 06, ADR-010). Until this landed, a repo only appeared in the
// machine-wide global store as a SIDE EFFECT of a work-mutating command (run
// start/complete, feedback) or the launcher's converge tick — there was no operator
// verb to say "make this repo visible in the mesh now". This module is that verb's
// core, kept out of cli.mjs so it is unit-testable without spawning the CLI.
//
// It does two things, in order:
//   (1) writes a per-repo PUBLISHED MARKER into the LOCAL .aof/aof.config.json
//       (`mesh.repo = { published, publishedAt, workspaceId, cloneUrl? }`) via a
//       read-merge-write that preserves every other key — the durable record that this
//       repo is a mesh repo (and, via ADR-010's gate extension in
//       global-work-publisher.mjs, the signal that its FUTURE work mutations auto-
//       propagate). The marker is written to the LOCAL on-disk config, never the
//       global-merged in-memory view, so the global mesh subtree (enabled/relay/
//       credential) is not copied down into the repo.
//   (2) publishes a snapshot NOW through the ONE publisher seam
//       (global-work-publisher.mjs's publishGlobalWorkSnapshot — the acd-global-
//       publisher-single-seam boundary), with the marker applied in-memory so the
//       propagation gate treats this repo as mesh-enabled for the immediate publish.
//
// Milestone 38 addition (`2026-07-16`, at the operator's direction — "check if it
// exists first, then add it if it doesn't", rejecting a separate `set-clone-url`
// verb as needless ceremony): if `mesh.repo.cloneUrl` is NOT already configured, this
// verb derives it from the repo's own `git remote get-url origin` and folds it into
// the SAME marker write — no manual JSON edit, no second command. An ALREADY-configured
// `cloneUrl` is never overwritten (git remote is only ever a fallback, never a source
// of truth once a value is committed). Detection failure (not a git repo, no `origin`
// remote, a malformed URL) is silent and non-fatal — the publish still succeeds with no
// `cloneUrl`, exactly today's behaviour when nobody configures one; a later clone-miss
// still fails loud and coded (`assignment-repo-unavailable`), per ADR-005.
