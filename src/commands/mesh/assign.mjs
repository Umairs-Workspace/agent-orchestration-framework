// `aof mesh assign <ref> --to <nodeId>` / `--withdraw` — the operator-directed
// dispatch verb (milestone 35 / story 00). The VERB only: its route, its refusal
// matrix and its one `--json` envelope. The assign/withdraw behaviour lives in
// src/mesh/assignment.mjs (m42 wave (d) leg d1 — see that module's header for why
// it sits below the command layer).
//
// WHY IT IS REGISTERED — the comment that stood above this module's entry in `src/command-core.mjs`,
// moved here unedited (119/02, FF-11908: the registry cites, it does not explain).
//
// From the comment above this module's registry import:
//   m42 wave (d) leg d1 (wave-3 tail) — the previously CLI-only nested mesh verbs
//   as registered Commands riding the route table: mesh:assign (--to/--withdraw,
//   + the --workspace residual closed), mesh:recover-push (global-store oriented,
//   workspace-free), mesh:repo-publish (the three-word route). Their cores stay
//   in the same modules for the white-box tests; cli.mjs's face copies +
//   emitMeshError are deleted. (The old acd-desktop-verbs-outside-bijection gate
//   that governed this boundary is acd-launcher-seam now — ui/serve ride the
//   launcher seam below; repo/desktop keep only their unknown-verb shims.)
//
// From the comment on `meshAssignCommand`'s COMMANDS entry:
//   m42 wave (d) leg d1 (wave-3 tail) — the nested verbs join the registry.

// mesh:assign — the registered Command over the two cores above (m42 wave (d)
// leg d1, wave-3 tail): `aof mesh assign <ref> --to <nodeId>` / `--withdraw`
// rides the route table + the ONE generic face; cli.mjs's meshAssignCommand
// face copy is deleted. A core-level coded refusal ({ ok:false, error, code, … })
// becomes a THROWN command error here, so the face's one envelope/exit policy
// applies; the cores themselves keep returning structured results for their
// white-box tests and any non-CLI caller. Declaring `--workspace` closes the
// m42 STATE residual (the cwd-independent assign the wrong-directory withdraw
// incident called for) — the generic face resolves it.
