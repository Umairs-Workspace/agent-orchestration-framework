// `aof mesh recover-push <assignmentId>` — the CONTROL-DRIVEN recovery push (VERIFICATION,
// live two-machine soak 2026-07-25). Run on the CONTROL node to rescue a stalled/terminal
// assignment whose worker output never reached origin (the worker parked at an idle prompt
// so its `done` push seam never fired, or the assignment was reclaimed with its diff
// stranded UNCOMMITTED in the worktree). A CLI-only nested verb (a sibling of `mesh assign`
// / `mesh repo publish`), kept out of cli.mjs so it is unit-testable without spawning the
// CLI (the mesh-assign.mjs precedent).
//
// It does NOT reach the worker itself (the CLI process holds no fabric socket — only the
// always-on control daemon does). Like every other dispatch in this system it is
// STORE-FIRST: this writes a `requested` row (mesh-recovery-push.mjs) that the daemon's
// control tick drains — minting a one-shot write credential and dispatching a recovery-push
// DOWN-frame to the assignment's target worker (resolved from the assignment record's OWN
// target_node_id, so the operator names only the assignmentId). The worker commits + pushes
// its worktree and reports back; this then polls the row to a terminal state and prints
// pushed / failed. The write credential is NEVER persisted — it rides the fabric one-shot;
// the store only ever holds the request + its status.
