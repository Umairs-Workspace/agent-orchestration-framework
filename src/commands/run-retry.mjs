// work:run-retry — resume a retryable failed run's lineage (20/ADR-003).
//
// A thin WRITE wrapper over story 00's src/run-store.mjs:retryRun (the run-start.mjs
// idiom). resume-vs-fresh is a VERB distinction, not a flag: run-retry RESUMES (carries
// the prior sessionId, attempt + 1, retryOf linking the lineage); work:run-start stays
// FRESH (19/ADR-003). It resolves the target with `resolveItemExact` — NO slug fallback,
// so a typo'd/partial ref returns ref-not-found rather than retrying a run on the wrong
// item (08/ADR-003 write-isolation, exactly as run-start does). The store performs every
// filesystem write under runs/ (19/ADR-002) and is the single classification authority —
// this command never re-derives the retryable/non-retryable table; it surfaces the
// store's coded rejections (not-retryable / attempts-exhausted / no-retryable-run)
// unchanged. The result is the new running run record (records carry refs, not paths).
//
// WHY IT IS REGISTERED — the comment that stood above this module's entry in `src/command-core.mjs`,
// moved here unedited (119/02, FF-11908: the registry cites, it does not explain).
//
//   milestone 20 — autonomous-run-resilience (story 01: resilience-commands — work:run-retry
//   registers into the SAME core; ADR-003). A thin WRITE wrapper over story 00's retryRun:
//   it RESUMES a retryable failed run's lineage (carries the prior sessionId, attempt + 1,
//   retryOf), the resume-vs-fresh verb distinction (run-start stays fresh). Additive (the
//   m09–m19 door); it takes the precedented BOARD_DEFERRED carve-out (board = m21) but
//   inherits the generic command-cli bijection (08/ADR-004).
