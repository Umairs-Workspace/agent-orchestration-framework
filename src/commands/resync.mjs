// work:resync — "ask the node that reported this cached row to push a fresh copy"
// (m43 / story 04, ADR-006 + ADR-010/R4.2).
//
// THE DOOR DESIGN SPECIFIES EXHAUSTIVELY AND NAMES NOWHERE. The board renders a Resync
// control on a stale item's provenance line; this is what it calls, and `aof work resync
// <ref>` is the same act from the CLI. It is the milestone's ONE sanctioned pull — every
// other flow here is a periodic push or a dispatch of WORK — and it is operator-initiated
// by construction, which is directive 4's "unless something is wrong" carve-out.
//
// IT REPORTS THE CALL, NEVER THE DATA. `ok: true` means the request reached the owning
// node; it does NOT mean a fresh copy has landed. Only a fresher `syncedAt` arriving on the
// list response proves that, which is why there is no success toast on the surface and no
// "refreshed" claim here. This is the m38 F22 rule ("it reports the CALL; region 5 reports
// the ASSIGNMENT") applied one milestone on.
//
// EVERY REFUSAL IS A RETURNED, CODED OUTCOME — never a throw. The offline owner is the
// LIKELY case (the row is stale precisely because its owner stopped reporting), so it is a
// designed state rather than an error path; a throw would make the honest answer look like
// a fault. Only a genuine infrastructure failure (the store refusing to open) still throws.
// This is `mesh:recover-push`'s contract verbatim, for the same reason.
//
// WHY IT IS REGISTERED — the comment that stood above this module's entry in `src/command-core.mjs`,
// moved here unedited (119/02, FF-11908: the registry cites, it does not explain).
//
// From the comment above this module's registry import:
//   m43 / story 04 (ADR-006 + ADR-010/R4.2) — work:resync, the milestone's ONE sanctioned
//   pull: ask the node that REPORTED a stale cached row to push a fresh copy. Registered into
//   the SAME core so the board's Resync control, `aof work resync <ref>` and any future face
//   all go through one door with one coded outcome vocabulary.
//
// From the comment on `resyncCommand`'s COMMANDS entry:
//   m43 / story 04 — the Resync door (see the import note).

// THE REQUEST-LEG BOUND IS DERIVED FROM THE CADENCE IT WAITS ON, never pinned to a literal
// (ADR-014/E5). DESIGN asked for "no indefinite spinner … design default 10s for the request
// round trip", and 10s was written against an assumed-INSTANT dispatch. The mechanism that
// was actually built is TICK-DRAINED: the request is a store row that the control daemon's
// dispatch tick picks up on `mesh.sync.cadenceSeconds` (documented default 15s). A request
// arrives at a uniformly random point inside that tick, so a 10s bound reported "no answer"
// for roughly one healthy request in THREE while the dispatch landed seconds later — and on
// the CLI face that is a non-zero exit on a working system. A bound shorter than the cadence
// it waits on does not measure the world; it measures the clock.
//
// So: TWO cadences of headroom, floored at DESIGN's 10s. Two rather than one because one
// covers only the perfectly-aligned case — a request landing just after a tick waits nearly a
// full cadence before the first drain even looks at it, and the row must then be re-read by
// the poll below. It scales with the knob, so an operator who slows the tick to a minute gets
// a bound that still measures the world rather than a deadline they did not know they moved.
//
// The WATCH WINDOW for the pushed copy itself is the UI's (3 poll intervals) and is
// deliberately a different leg — a slow-but-successful push must not be swallowed by the
// request leg's deadline.
