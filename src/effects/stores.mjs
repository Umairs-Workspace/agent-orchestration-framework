// src/effects/stores.mjs — the STORE CLASSIFICATION (m42 wave (d) leg d5;
// PRD-command-spine-effects-ledger "fact-projection-split"). The epistemology
// made explicit and EXECUTABLE: every table in the shared per-node SQLite (and
// every file store the ledger touches) is declared FACT, PROJECTION, or META —
// replacing the "MUST NEVER touch" warning comments that used to be the only
// thing standing between the wholesale row publisher and a dispatch fact.
//
//   fact        — authored or observed state whose truth lives HERE (or arrived
//                 here as a durable report). Losing it loses truth: no local
//                 rebuild reconstructs it. Written ONLY by its declared writer
//                 module(s), one row at a time — never wholesale.
//   projection  — derived from facts that live elsewhere (this workspace's disk,
//                 a descriptor file, a peer's publish). Safe to delete + rebuild;
//                 healing one is a re-publish/reconcile, never a patch (the port-3
//                 rule). `work_items` was the example here until m43/ADR-004 made it
//                 a FACT: it is neither remapped nor rebuilt now — a renumber is
//                 RE-REPORTED, row by row, by the node that authored each row.
//   meta        — the store's own bookkeeping (schema versions, watermarks,
//                 event-dedup stamps). Neither truth nor derivation.
//
// This registry is DATA ONLY (no imports from the stores it classifies — it is
// imported BY them, and by the gates/doctor that render it). Consumers:
//   - global-work-store.mjs: wholesale deletes are guarded by class (a DELETE
//     that sweeps a fact table throws before it runs), and the insert/reindex
//     ref-remap derives its table lists — split by locus — from here.
//   - test/arch/acd-fact-projection-split: totality (every CREATE TABLE in src/
//     is classified, every classified table exists — a two-way ratchet), the
//     writer isolation per fact table, and the wholesale-delete guard.
//   - work:doctor --explain: renders a store's class beside its cascade.

// The shared per-node SQLite (projection.sqlite — one file, BOTH classes, which
// is exactly why the split must be schema-level and not a comment). `writers`
// names the module(s) whose SQL may INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE rows of a fact table
// (repo-relative). `refRemap` marks the ref-keyed tables an insert/reindex must
// follow, with the LOCUS whose drain may rewrite them: the streamed mirrors are
// this node's own rows (`local`); the dispatch facts belong to the authoritative
// mesh store's writer (`control-store`) — the split port 3 deferred to this leg.
