// src/effects/stream-transitions.mjs — the WORK STREAM's transition seam (m42 wave
// (d) leg d4, port 3). The fourth seam, beside run-transitions.mjs (the run store),
// assignment-transitions.mjs (the assignment store) and doc-transitions.mjs (the
// record docs).
//
// THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES. `aof work insert-*` opens a slot by renaming folders and
// rewriting the `depends`/`parent` values that name the moved numbers — and stops.
// But an item's REF is the join key of six other stores, and the renumber told none
// of them: the run records inside the renamed folder still stamp the old ref, the
// Notion sidecar still binds `03` to the page that is now item `04` (so the next
// sync overwrites a page with another item's content — the measured symptom), and
// the streamed doc/run rows, assignment rows and item branches all keep the ref they
// were written with. Nothing was wrong at the call site; the consequence simply had
// no home. It has one now: `stream.reindexed`, whose reactors are declared in
// effects/table.mjs.
//
// File-store discipline is run-transitions.mjs's: write-then-append, with the d5
// reconciler scan closing the window between them. The REMAP is computed by the
// engine BEFORE its renames (work-reindex.mjs's buildRefRemap) — after them the old
// refs exist nowhere to be derived from, so the event must carry them.

// both insert call sites already route through — rather than in the cache's upsert
// seam: an insert RENUMBERS FOLDERS while a worker holds a worktree full of the old
// refs, which is the destructive case the lock exists for, and it is this seam that
