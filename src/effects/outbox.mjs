// src/effects/outbox.mjs — the DURABLE OUTBOX for remote-locus effect steps
// (m42 wave (d) leg d3; PRD-command-spine-effects-ledger: "facts over the bridge").
//
// THE MEASURED DEFECT. Worker->control facts were fire-once frames. STATE
// 2026-07-27, verbatim: "Worker startup-reclaim frames are fire-once — the Mac
// worker restarted in the ~3-min window while the control was ALSO down; its
// `failed/daemon-restarted` report for run 0017's stranded worktree died on the
// dead connection, and the control row read a stale `running` for 35+ min". A
// fact that only exists while a socket happens to be open is not a fact, it is a
// hope. This module makes worker->control facts survive the connection.
//
// HOW IT WORKS — no second queue. A step whose locus this process cannot reach is
// ALREADY a durable row in the journal (`effect_steps`, status `pending`); the
// dispatcher leaves it alone (`deferred`). The outbox is the delivery half of
// that same row:
//
//   1. drainOutbox() reads the pending steps whose locus is remote and hands each
//      to the injected `send` — in production, one `effect-step` up-frame on the
//      worker's already-open stream.
//   2. Delivery is NOT completion. The step stays `pending` until the control
//      node ACKs it by (eventId, reactorKey) — the durable receipt. So a frame
//      lost in flight, or a control that died mid-apply, simply redelivers on the
//      next drain. AT-LEAST-ONCE by construction, which is exactly the contract
//      every reactor already promises (idempotent or event-id-deduped).
//   3. A failed SEND is not an attempt. Being offline is the normal case, not a
//      fault, so it never burns the attempts budget — otherwise a worker that
//      restarts while control is down would exhaust its retries against nobody
//      and silently drop the fact, recreating the very defect.
//   4. An ACK carrying a coded refusal ends the step: `skipped`, with the code
//      recorded. Redelivering a fact the control node has REFUSED (an unknown
//      assignment, a row another writer already settled) would loop forever.

// WORKSPACE-scoped — it drains where its workspace's config and credentials are
