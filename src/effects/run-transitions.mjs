// src/effects/run-transitions.mjs — the run store's TRANSITION seam (m42 wave (d) leg
// d2; PRD flow: face → invoke → transition → drain). transitionRunComplete is
// the ONLY place that both writes the run-completion fact AND raises its
// `run.completed` event — callers stop re-remembering the cascade (rollback,
// publish, …) because they can no longer reach the fact-write without the
// event. The store (run-store.mjs) stays mesh-blind and event-blind; the seam
// wraps it, never replaces it (the write seams are kept, not replaced).
//
// File-store discipline: the run record is a FILE store, so this is
// write-then-append (fact first, event second) with the d5 reconciler scan
// closing the crash window between them — chosen over 2PC, knowingly (PRD
// §settled design). A crash after the write leaves a fact without its event;
// the scan re-derives it. A crash after the append leaves PENDING steps any
// later drain pays out — the property the whole arc exists for.

// seam, for the same reason completeRun did: its consequence (publish-on-mutate)

//          attempts-exhausted / duplicate-run — propagating untouched, nothing
//          appended); anything else is the fresh mint (startRun, whose
