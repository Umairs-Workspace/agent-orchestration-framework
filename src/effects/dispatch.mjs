// src/effects/dispatch.mjs — the topology-aware effects dispatcher (m42 wave (d)
// leg d2). Runs the steps a journal owes whose locus THIS process can reach;
// leaves remote-locus steps pending for the outbox (leg d3). Two drain modes by
// design: the CLI face drains synchronously before exit (per-reactor outcomes in
// the result envelope); daemons drain on the converge tick (d3). Failures are
// events, never silence: a failing reactor marks its step `failed` (retried
// while under the attempts ceiling), reports a coded degrade, and NEVER aborts
// the drain — one consequence's fault cannot strand its siblings.
