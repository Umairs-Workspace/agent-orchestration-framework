// src/worker-stream-client.mjs — the worker's persistent live-state stream client
// (milestone 34 / story 04, ADR-007). A worker opens and holds a connection to the
// control node and streams work-state as it happens: the FIRST frame on any
// (re)connection is a full SNAPSHOT, subsequent work-state changes are DELTAs; a drop
// reconnects with growing/capped backoff and re-sends a snapshot first; a stream
// fault NEVER blocks or rolls back a local work write (ADR-004 failure isolation,
// extended to the live stream).
//
// THE WIRE FRAME (an ADR-007 open question this build resolves — documented, not
// frozen elsewhere): { kind: "snapshot" | "delta", nodeId, workspaceId, items, at }
// for work state, plus { kind: "presence", nodeId, presence, at } for durable worker
// liveness in the control node's global presence store.
//   - "snapshot" — items is the FULL current item-row array for the workspace (the
//                  SAME row shape global-work-store.mjs's readWorkspaceProjectionItems
//                  produces: { ref, type, slug, status, title, parent, sourcePath }).
//   - "delta"    — items is the array of CHANGED rows only (typically one).
// `at` is the ISO timestamp the frame was assembled (the injected clock, never
// wall-clock in a test).
//
// THE TRANSPORT SEAM: `transport` is INJECTED — { connect(), send(frame), close(),
// onDrop(handler) } — production wires createWorkerWsTransport() (a persistent ws@8
// socket), tests wire a fake recorder/dropper (the STORY.md build-note: the
// one-shot mesh-relay-client fake does not fit a persistent multi-frame channel, so
// this is NET-NEW test infrastructure). connect() may reject (fault); send() may
// reject/throw (fault) — BOTH are caught here and NEVER propagate to the caller of
// streamWorkerState()/notify() (ADR-004: a stream fault is a warning, never a
// rethrow).
//
// THE BACKOFF SCHEDULE (pure function, no wall clock): attempt n (1-based, the COUNT
// of consecutive drops so far) → delaySeconds = min(2^(n-1), 30). n=1→1s, 2→2s,
// 3→4s, 9→30s (the STORY.md examples, verbatim).

// `credential` (2026-07-27, the `direct` fabric cutover) — this node's enrollment
// relayAuth token (config.mesh.credential.relayAuth). When present it rides the ws
// UPGRADE in an `Authorization: Bearer …` header, which is how the control node
// resolves WHO this connection is on a fabric that has no address oracle. The header
// name/prefix matches the relay broker's own auth gate (mesh-relay.mjs's
// readPresentedCredential) so both surfaces read the credential identically.
// ABSENT is not an error here — a node that never enrolled simply connects without
// one and is refused at the gate, which is the honest outcome.
