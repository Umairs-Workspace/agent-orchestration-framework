// The `graphify` memory backend (milestone 10, story 00 — the SPINE).
//
// It satisfies the FROZEN 05 backend interface (05/ADR-003): the default export is
// EXACTLY { name, recall, reindex, status } with name === "graphify". It is a thin
// composition of two independently-frozen halves (ADR-001):
//   - RECORDS come from milestone-05's markdown parsers, REUSED untouched: the pure
//     `buildRecords` (05 indexing) + `rankRecords`/`applyScope`/`normalizeScope`/
//     `renderRecallText` (05 retrieval). Every record stays a frozen `MemoryRecord`
//     with a resolving `source:line` — the graph is NEVER the record source.
//   - The GRAPH is a derived re-rank SIGNAL only. `reindex` (re)builds a work-stream
//     graph under `graphify-out/` by reaching graphify EXCLUSIVELY through the 09
//     `graph:build` command via `invoke(...)` (ADR-002) — it spawns nothing, imports
//     NEITHER `../graphify.mjs` NOR `node:child_process`.
//
// Story-00 scope: the re-ranker is STUBBED to the 05 base ranking (story 01 adds the
// graph term). `reindex`'s graph build FAILS SOFT — when the binary is absent (the CI
// reality), the structured `graphify-missing` miss is caught and the records-rebuilt
// result still returns successfully (graph skipped); the records half is the
// @executable assertion. The full binary-absent degrade across every verb +
// claude-cli classification is story 02.
//
// Own store (a CONTRACT refinement): 05's `memoryIndexPath` hardcodes
// `.aof/aof.memory.index.json` with `backend:"local"` baked in, so this backend
// writes its OWN derived store at `.aof/aof.memory.graphify.index.json`, labelled
// `backend:"graphify"`, REUSING the pure `buildRecords` (NOT 05's `reindex` writer) —
// zero edits to 05's shipped code.

// `rerank(records, normalizedGraph, query, scope, opts)` is a PURE function: the 05
// base ranking (`rankRecords`, 05/ADR-006) over the scoped survivors, then a
// file-level graph-relatedness boost layered ON TOP of each record's base score. It
// RE-RANKS, never replaces: the returned set is EXACTLY the base-ranked candidate
// set (same records by id), only the ORDER (and the numeric `score`) changes, and no
// MemoryRecord field is added (only `score`). It NEVER throws on a null/empty graph.
//
// THE JOIN IS FILE-LEVEL (ADR-001). A record is boosted via ITS FILE's relatedness —
// `MemoryRecord.source`'s `<path>` (its basename file) ↔ `GraphNode.sourceFile` —
// NEVER via a graph node id (the LLM assigns ids; they drift across rebuilds). Two
// records in the SAME file therefore get the SAME graph signal and stay adjacent; the
// base ranking orders them WITHIN the file.
//
// THREE ADR-001 RELATEDNESS CHANNELS, each normalized to [0,1] over the candidate
// files, then weighted and summed into a bounded boost:
//   (1) COMMUNITY co-membership with the query anchor's community — a candidate file
//       in the anchor's community is topically clustered with the query.
//   (2) EDGE relatedness to the anchor — a candidate file's node connected to an
//       anchor node, INFERRED/`semantically_similar_to` edges weighted by their
//       `confidenceScore` (09/ADR-003 preserves it ONLY on INFERRED).
//   (3) GOD-NODE CENTRALITY — the candidate file's node edge degree, normalized by
//       the max candidate degree; the highest-degree (god-node-central) file leads.
//
// THE BOOST IS A LAYER, NOT A REPLACEMENT (ADR-001 boundary). The total graph boost
// is bounded by GRAPH_BOOST_MAX, calibrated SMALLER than a clear base-relevance gap
// (a title-match term is 0.6; a decisive content lead is larger) — so the graph flips
// a base TIE (the fixture's 4-way tie → ISOLATED falls, CENTRAL leads) but does NOT
// invert a record the base ranking already scores decisively higher.

// The maximum total graph boost (sum of the three weighted channels). Kept below one
// title-match term (0.6) so the graph layers onto comparable-relevance records and
// never overrides a clearly stronger base match (ADR-001 boundary / 05/ADR-006).
