// src/artifact-sync.mjs — the write-triggered artifact sync's DRAIN half
// (milestone 43 / ADR-001).
//
// The producer is `.claude/hooks/aof/artifact-sync-enqueue.mjs`, a PostToolUse hook
// that derives nothing and appends one NDJSON line per artifact write. THIS module is
// the consumer: the worker daemon drains that queue on its EXISTING stream tick
// (`pushActiveWorktreeState`, mesh-launcher.mjs), de-duplicates by path, and hands the
// tick a batch. No new timer, no new transport, no new listening surface.
//
// LOSS-AVERSION IS THE CONTRACT, the mechanism is rename-then-read. A drain moves the
// queue aside to a BATCH file and leaves it there; only a confirmed send discards it.
// An interruption at ANY point therefore RE-SENDS rather than loses — a duplicate send
// is harmless (the content tables are upserted per (ref, doc)), so re-send is always
// the safe side to fail to.
//
// WHAT THE HOOK BUYS, STATED HONESTLY. The tick still runs the reconciliation
// backstop STATE mandates keeping — a full read of the item subtree's manifest
// artifacts — because a `Bash`-written file is deliberately outside the hook's matcher
// and must still converge on the very next tick. So the hook does NOT remove the local
// read; what it removes is the WIRE cost and the silence:
//   - the per-artifact CONTENT hash means an unchanged artifact is never re-sent, so
//     a steady-state tick carries no bodies at all (ADR-007/AC8);
//   - the queue NAMES what the agent touched, which is how a named-but-now-missing
//     artifact becomes a coded degrade instead of a silent nothing;
//   - an `unresolved-path` line reaches an operator instead of dying in the hook.
// This is recorded rather than glossed: ADR-001's "O(changed)" is realised on the
// wire, not on the local read, for as long as the one-tick backstop is required.
