// The graphify rendered faces (milestone 09 / story 02 — ADR-005).
//
// aof authors its OWN graphify skill + MCP config entry as ordinary aof config
// items, rendered through the EXISTING asset/lock/drift machinery
// (`renderConfigOutputs`, src/adapters.mjs) — NO new render path. The skill is a
// `resource` (rendered by `renderedResource` into `.claude`/`.codex`); the MCP
// entry is an `mcpServers` entry (rendered by `renderRuntimeConfigOutputs` →
// `claudeMcpJson` → `.mcp.json` for claude, `codexConfigToml` → `config.toml` for
// codex). Both flow through the same hash/lock so `aof project doctor`'s
// `generated-output-drift` check covers them like any other rendered output.
//
// Two ADR-005 constraints are load-bearing and asserted by story 02's tests:
//   1. The SKILL instructs `aof graph build/query/triage` (the aof CLI), and NEVER
//      graphify's shipped `/graphify` slash-form (binary-divergent, RESEARCH §A)
//      nor calling the `graphify` binary directly.
//   2. The MCP entry's command/args launch the AOF-FRONTED server `aof graph serve`
//      (story 04's runtime), NOT graphify's own `python -m graphify.serve` (whose
//      9 read tools omit PR triage and bypass the command core, RESEARCH §H).
//
// HOME (the shipped-resource decision, see the developer return): NOT the ACD
// `src/bundle/` — that bundle is the frozen ACD-actor set (8 agents + the ACD
// commands + templates), pinned by the milestone-01 `acd-bundle-membership`
// fitness function ("bundle root files == declared member files"); adding a
// graphify face there would break that frozen invariant, and the bundle loader
// supports neither `skill` members nor `mcpServers`. Instead, mirroring
// `work-bundle.mjs`'s idiom — a module that exports a config-SHAPED object
// consumed by `renderConfigOutputs` unchanged — this module ships the graphify
// faces as a first-class config fragment any aof project adopts by spreading
// `graphifyFacesConfig()` into its config. This authors them as aof's OWN config
// items (ADR-005's "aof authors graphify faces as ITS OWN assets") without
// touching the ACD bundle or `src/frameworks.mjs`.
