// src/mesh/resync.mjs — the RESYNC transport (m43 / story 04, ADR-006 + ADR-010/R4.2).
//
// THE ASK, in one sentence: the operator is looking at a cached copy that has gone stale,
// and wants the node that reported it to push a fresh one. Nothing in this system carried a
// node→node "push me your state" request before this module — every other flow is either a
// periodic tick or a dispatch of WORK. This is the milestone's ONE sanctioned pull, and it
// is operator-initiated by construction: directive 4's "unless something is wrong"
// carve-out, which is why it exists as a door on a stale row and nowhere else.
//
// THE SHAPE is `mesh-recovery-push.mjs`'s, deliberately and verbatim in structure, because
// that flow already solved the same problem (a control-node CLI cannot reach a worker — only
// the always-on control daemon holds a fabric socket):
//   1. the CLI / board face writes a `requested` row here (a plain local store write, which
//      only a local operator on the control node can perform),
//   2. the control daemon's tick (runResyncDispatchTick, below) drains `requested` rows and
//      dispatches a `work-resync` DOWN-frame to the owning node's connected socket, marking
//      the row `dispatched` — DESIGN's **accepted**,
//   3. the worker pushes a fresh snapshot + worktree delta + content frame and replies with
//      a `work-resync-result` UP-frame,
//   4. applyResyncResultFrame (below) flips the row `pushed`/`failed`,
//   5. the caller polls the row to a terminal state within a BOUNDED window and reports.
//
// THE STORE SURFACE is a NEW, ADDITIVE table (global_resync_requests) created LAZILY here
// via `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` — operator-CREATED state, never a projection of any doc,
// so (exactly like global_assignments and global_recovery_pushes) the row publisher must
// never touch it. Creating it here rather than in global-work-store.mjs's migrate keeps the
// feature self-contained and needs NO schema-version bump: the table is a pure add and every
// accessor ensures it first.
//
// WHERE IT DIFFERS FROM RECOVERY-PUSH, and why — one difference, and it is the point of the
// feature. Recovery-push leaves a row `requested` when its target is not connected and
// retries every tick, because a stranded worktree must eventually get home whenever the
// worker returns. Resync marks it `failed` with a CODE on the first tick instead: DESIGN's
// "owner unreachable" is a first-class DESIGNED state that the operator is waiting on, and a
// silent retry ladder would turn "the world did not answer" into a spinner that never
// resolves — "no answer" would be structurally guaranteed rather than measured.
//
// This module has NO top-level repo import at all — the store module it needs is pulled in
// LAZILY inside the dispatch tick's default `openStore`, mirroring mesh-recovery-push.mjs —
// so worker-stream-client.mjs and control-stream-server.mjs can import the wire-kind
// literals, the coded outcomes and the frame builders from here (the ONE contract home)
// without dragging sqlite into the transport leaf.

// THE DOWN- and UP-frame kinds (the single source of both literals — imported by
// worker-stream-client.mjs's receive branch and control-stream-server.mjs's apply, never
// re-spelled at a call site).
export const RESYNC_KIND = "work-resync";
export const RESYNC_RESULT_KIND = "work-resync-result";

// The request lifecycle states — `requested` is the ONLY state the dispatch tick acts on;
// `dispatched` is DESIGN's **accepted** (the request reached the owner) and is already a
// terminal answer for the CALL; `pushed`/`failed` are the worker's own verdict. A re-request
// for the same item resets the row to `requested` (requestResync's upsert), so a retry after
// any terminal outcome starts clean — the row is never wedged.

// THE CODED OUTCOMES — the wire contract every face reads, mapped 1:1 onto DESIGN's Resync
// state table so no surface has to invent its own vocabulary:
//
//   resync-requested            → DESIGN "accepted"          (ok, muted acknowledgement)
//   resync-no-owner             → DESIGN "refused"           (DESTRUCTIVE — a fault we own)
//   resync-owner-not-connected  → DESIGN "owner unreachable"  (muted)
//   resync-owner-unreachable    → DESIGN "owner unreachable"  (muted)
//   resync-pending              → DESIGN "no answer"          (muted — the request leg's bound)
//   resync-owner-is-self        → DESIGN "owner unreachable"  (muted — see below)
//
// The tone split is DESIGN's rule and it is load-bearing: MUTED means the world did not
// answer (the cached copy is intact and still the only readable one, so reddening it would
// over-alarm exactly the condition this milestone exists to normalise); DESTRUCTIVE means the
// request was REJECTED. Only `resync-no-owner` is a rejection.
//
// THE FIFTH CODE, and why the first four could not carry it (ADR-014/E2, which overrules the
// build's own earlier judgement). The four above are a WIRE vocabulary — each names the
// outcome of a node→node CALL: there is nobody to ask; we looked for a socket and found none;
// the send did not complete; we asked and waited. A resync of a row THIS node authored makes
// no call at all, so it cannot be an outcome of one. Answering it `resync-owner-not-connected`
// named a connectivity fact that was never tested, and its own message ("there is no peer to
// fetch it from") contradicted the code. The operator consequence is the common case, not an
// exotic one: a control-authored row goes stale exactly when the control's own publish tick
// stops — daemon down, workspace unregistered, publish erroring — and pointing the operator at
// the network for a wholly local condition is the misdiagnosis this milestone exists to end.
// `resync-no-owner` is not the answer either: there IS an owner, and that code is DESIGN's
// DESTRUCTIVE "refused" for a state where nothing was rejected and nothing failed.
