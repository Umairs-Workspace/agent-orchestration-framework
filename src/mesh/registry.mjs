// src/mesh/registry.mjs — the group registry: the group-level, control-node-owned
// SINGLE-WRITER global registry (milestone 24, ADR-001) — the roster of admitted
// nodes + the set of registered boards + the pending-invite records + the revocation
// list, held as ONE aggregate file under meshDir/registry/ in the global mesh home.
//
// THE SINGLE-WRITER INVARIANT (ADR-001 decision 1): 22/ADR-002 forbids an aggregate
// file two nodes co-write. The registry is a legitimately DIFFERENT artifact because
// exactly ONE writer mutates it: the nominated control node (config.mesh.relay.controlNode
// === config.mesh.nodeId — the same predicate relayMode gates on). writeRegistry is the
// ONE write seam; a non-control invocation is a structured no-op — it writes nothing
// and throws nothing, leaving an existing file byte-unchanged. Single-writer ⇒ no
// multi-writer conflict ⇒ the m22 hazard does not apply.
// Like the mesh-store spine it sits beside, this module references zero record-doc
// filename (record-doc resolution lives in work.mjs, never a store), every fs write
// joins the registryDir/registryPath partition seam, and every persist routes through
// the atomic temp+rename writeText seam (19/R2). The registry is persisted OPAQUE /
// AS-IS — no normalization, no reshaping: an unknown additive top-level key survives
// byte-equivalent + key-order-preserved (the 22/ADR-003 additive-friendly discipline).
//
// The aggregate mutations are PURE, ADD-ONLY helpers over a registry VALUE (a registry
// in, a registry out — no fs, no clock): roster append (order-preserving), boards
// set-add (a repeat is a no-op, first-appearance order kept), revocation append (an
// explicit deny record, distinct from roster removal — ADR-004), pending-invite append
// ({ codeHash, issuedAt, expiresAt, consumedAt: null } — the durable record carries a
// codeHash, NEVER a plaintext device-code field; the hashing crypto is story 01's,
// security-owned), and the single-use consume (a marker on the one record, never a
// rewrite of its siblings). Time is INJECTED everywhere (admittedAt / revokedAt /
// issuedAt / expiresAt / now are caller-supplied values — the 22/R2 discipline, no
// wall-clock read here), so the TTL boundary is deterministic: an invite is expired
// ONLY when now is STRICTLY greater than expiresAt (at exactly expiresAt the invite is
// still presentable — the m20 isStale strict-> boundary the mesh reuses).
