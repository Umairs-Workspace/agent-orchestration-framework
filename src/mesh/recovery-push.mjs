// src/mesh/recovery-push.mjs — the CONTROL-DRIVEN recovery push (VERIFICATION, live
// two-machine soak 2026-07-25). Story 07 (ADR-015) taught the worker to push its
// branch home ON its OWN push seam — but ONLY while the assignment is still ACTIVE
// (the write-credential PULL is holder+active-state gated, SECURITY T6/F16). When a
// worker STALLS (interactive `claude` parks at an idle prompt so `term.onExit` never
// fires — the exact live-soak defect) or an assignment is otherwise left terminal with
// its diff stranded UNCOMMITTED in the worktree, there is no active flow left to do the
// pulling: the work sits on the worker's disk and never reaches origin (measured: a
// full refine — 7 stories + ADRs + ~180KB of docs — stuck on the Mac; the board read
// "not-started" over completed work).
//
// This is the OPERATOR-DRIVEN recovery path: `aof mesh recover-push <assignmentId>`,
// run on the CONTROL node. The operator running it on the control node IS the
// authorization (there is no worker-initiated request here, and therefore no
// active-state gate — recovery exists PRECISELY to rescue a terminal/stalled
// assignment's work). The token is NEVER persisted (the whole ADR-015 discipline): the
// store carries only the REQUEST + its status; the daemon mints a fresh short-lived
// write credential and hands it to the worker over the SAME tailnet fabric channel the
// write-credential reply already rides, one-shot.
//
// THE SHAPE mirrors the established store-first dispatch (mesh-assignment-reclaim.mjs):
//   1. the CLI writes a `requested` row here (a plain local store write — only a local
//      operator on the control node can do this),
//   2. the control daemon's tick (runRecoveryPushDispatchTick, below) drains `requested`
//      rows whose target worker is a currently-connected admitted peer, MINTS the write
//      credential (the injected control-side mint — the App private key lives on control
//      only) and dispatches a `recovery-push` DOWN-frame carrying it, marking the row
//      `dispatched`,
//   3. the worker commits + pushes its worktree and replies with a `recovery-push-result`
//      UP-frame (worker-stream-client / mesh-worker-execution),
//   4. applyRecoveryPushResultFrame (below) flips the row `pushed`/`failed`,
//   5. the CLI polls the row to a terminal state and prints pushed / failed.
//
// THE STORE SURFACE is a NEW, ADDITIVE table (global_recovery_pushes) created LAZILY
// here via `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` — it is operator/worker-CREATED state, never a
// projection of any doc, so (exactly like global_assignments) publishWorkspaceSnapshot
// must never touch it. Creating it here rather than in global-work-store.mjs's migrate
// keeps the feature self-contained and needs no schema-version bump (the table is a
// pure add; every accessor ensures it first).
//
// This module's ONLY top-level import is meshItemBranchName (a pure string helper) —
// the heavier global-work-store is pulled in LAZILY inside the dispatch tick's default
// openStore, so worker-stream-client.mjs can import the wire-kind literals + the result
// frame builder from here (the ONE contract home) without dragging sqlite into the
// transport leaf.
