// src/mesh/relay-client.mjs — the NODE-SIDE relay client (milestone 23 / story 02 /
// ADR-003). The thin { connect, push } seam a node uses to push its presence signal to
// the control node's serveRelay (story 01) over ws@8 — the LIVENESS half of
// push-for-liveness, poll-for-durability. It is the ACCELERATOR, never the floor: the
// durable git write (story 00) happens UNCONDITIONALLY first; this client is pushed
// BEST-EFFORT second and a connect/push failure is CAUGHT, never thrown (ADR-003,
// fitness #4). Kill the relay and this client simply fails — the git record is already
// safe (data safe, liveness lost).
//
// THE INJECTED SEAM (the @executable feasibility lever — tasks 00/01's Background): the
// publish path takes an INJECTED relay client { connect, push } so the four relay states
// (up / down-connect-throws / unconfigured / push-throws) are reachable in CI with NO
// real ws server. This module ships:
//   - pushPresenceSignal(relayClient, envelope) — the one-shot, BEST-EFFORT push the
//     two-publish path calls (it connects, pushes ONE frame, and disposes — it holds no
//     long-lived socket; a heartbeat is a discrete publish). It NEVER swallows the throw
//     itself: the catch lives in mesh-heartbeat.mjs's two-publish path (so fitness #4 can
//     read the try/catch on the publish-path source). This function PROPAGATES a
//     connect/push failure to its caller's try/catch.
//   - relayEnvelope(nodeId, signal) — builds story 01's FROZEN { kind, nodeId, signal }
//     with kind "presence" and the presence record as the OPAQUE signal blob.
//   - createRelayClient(config) — the production client, or null when the relay is
//     UNCONFIGURED (no config.mesh.relay.url) so the push is SKIPPED (not attempted —
//     distinct from attempt-then-catch). It is a thin wrapper over a ws@8 socket whose
//     real-socket behaviour is exercised by the @manual fleet spike (task 02), NOT
//     @executable CI — so it stays a thin, injectable seam.
import { WebSocket } from "ws";
// m42 item 3 — every former silent catch reports a coded degrade event.
import { reportDegrade } from "../degrade.mjs";

// byte-for-byte without parsing — fitness #2). A pure projection of its inputs.
//
// m42 item 0 (the deletion pass): the LEASE second-kind surface that used to live
// beside this (LEASE_SIGNAL_KIND / leaseRelayEnvelope / pushLeaseSignal) is DELETED —
// the m26 lease era was superseded by m35's assignment record, its last caller
// retired with acd-claim-relay-independent, and dead wire kinds are exactly the

// stays on the publish-path source, where fitness #4 reads it). A null/absent relayClient
