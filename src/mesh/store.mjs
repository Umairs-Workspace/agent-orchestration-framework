// src/mesh/store.mjs — the mesh-store: the path-partition seam (ADR-002), the
// frozen node-record schema's opaque per-node persist/read (ADR-003), addressed
// only by node id. The low-fan-out SPINE the mesh:* commands (stories 01/02) and
// milestones 23/24/26 all couple through — the exact role src/run-store.mjs plays
// for the run dimension (milestone 22 story 00).
//
// THE PARTITION INVARIANT (ADR-002, frozen): every mesh record file is owned and
// addressed by EXACTLY ONE node id, built from a SINGLE seam (meshDir/nodeRecordPath),
// so two nodes never write the same path. The active mesh root is machine-global, not
// repository-local; WebSocket streams and global projections are the sync surface, not
// a per-workspace git bus. There is NO shared or aggregate file two nodes co-write
// (no nodes.json roster).
//
// Mesh is AOF runtime state — a cross-cutting, extensible concept (planning too, not
// only the work stream) — so the active mesh store anchors in the global AOF home
// (`AOF_GLOBAL_HOME` or `~/.aof`), outside project `.aof` output/config.
// Like run-store, this module references ZERO record-doc filename (SPEC.md/STORY.md/
// STATE.md/SESSION.md): record-doc resolution lives in work.mjs, never here (the
// write-scope guard, fitness #2). Every write joins meshDir/nodeRecordPath and routes
// through the atomic temp+rename writeText seam (19/R2). UNLIKE run-store the
// mesh-store persists the node record OPAQUE / AS-IS — NO normalization, NO schema
// reshaping (descriptor assembly is story 01): an unknown additive key and a nested
// mixed-type value survive byte-equivalent + key-order-preserved.

// (26/ADR-001.1) the builder's AUTHORITY lives in run-store.mjs (the import

// AOF_GLOBAL_HOME), initialized once per machine, propagated between machines over the
// WebSocket stream (ADR-007) — NOT the git bus (the git-bus mesh transport is retired;
// see ADR-007). No `workspace` anchor anymore — every workspace on the machine sees the
