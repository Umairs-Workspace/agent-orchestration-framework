// THE WRITE-SCOPE DISCIPLINE (ADR-002 / fitness #3, acd-presence-write-scope, the

// presenceRecordPath / meshDir seam and routes through the atomic temp+rename
// writeText seam (19/R2) — NEVER a bare writeFile. This module references ZERO
// record-doc filename (SPEC.md/STORY.md/STATE.md/SESSION.md): record-doc resolution
// lives in work.mjs, never here. The presence record is persisted OPAQUE / AS-IS
// (pretty JSON), so a read-back is byte-equivalent.
//
// THE RECORD IS DERIVED / REBUILDABLE (22/ADR-003 discipline): a projection of the
// install's clock + its run records, NEVER a second authority. Re-deriving it from
// the same inputs yields a content-equivalent record. activeRuns is a READ of the run
// records m20/m19 own — it does NOT re-implement a run scan and does NOT mutate a run
// record (it reads the run dimension and publishes to the presence dimension).

//     than an `undefined` that would serialise away.
//   - `workspaceHasRun` TRAILS as the derived policy-INPUT (m48/ADR-004): "at least one

//     names the OBSERVATION, never the decision — subsumption is a display RULE the

//     set the launcher alone can compute — and it never REMOVES a session: the stamp
//     describes a workspace.
//   - m48/ADR-009: this is the ONE home of the projection. The stamp lands HERE, never
//     inline in the launcher (the widest-out-degree file in src/), so the session
//     projection is not split across two modules.
// A set that is absent — or is not a Set at all — degrades to the EMPTY default, so an

// `global_workspace_descriptors` (the store's own descriptor columns — no second
// enumeration strategy). FAILURE-ISOLATED (never a daemon crash):

// already absolute (the write-side fix's canonical output), so this is the SAME
// resolve either way: it makes a post-fix row correct AND tolerates a legacy row
// still holding the pre-fix raw relative string, with zero migration.
