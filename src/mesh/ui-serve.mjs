// The `aof mesh ui` fleet serve-face — the "fleet mission-control" web surface
// (milestone 25 / story 02; ARCHITECTURE ADR-003/ADR-004). A SIBLING to
// `board-serve.mjs`, NOT an extension of the work UI: it stands up its OWN single
// `http.createServer` bound to `127.0.0.1`, serving the BUILT `ui/dist` bundle
// announced at the fleet's own PATH (milestone 45 / ADR-002), its `/api/mesh/status` read route, and its board drill-in URL route.
//
// milestone 34 / story 03 (34/ADR-006) — `GET /api/mesh/status` now DEFAULTS to
// the machine-wide GLOBAL projection (via `queryGlobalMeshStatus`,
// ./global-mesh-query.mjs — the ONE additional query surface this face is allowed
// to reach); `serveMeshUi({ scope: "local" })` (the CLI's `--local`) reads the
// same global projection narrowed to the current workspace id, and a globally-
// started server still honours a `?scope=local` deep-link
// by narrowing the SAME global query to the current workspace id. The face stays
// thin either way: it never opens the SQLite projection itself and never imports
// global-work-store.mjs/global-node-registry.mjs directly — only the one
// composition seam.
//
// It is deliberately NOT `serveSetupUi` (the board's server): that server
// unconditionally wires `handleWorkApi` (a `/api/work` surface) AND
// `attachTerminalWebSocket` (a `/ws/terminal` upgrade), both of which this face
// FORBIDS (ADR-004; ADR-003 disjoint `/api/mesh` namespace). So the fleet face
// owns its own thin server whose surface is exactly: the static bundle,
// GET /api/mesh/status, GET /api/mesh/board-url, POST /api/mesh/assign and
// POST /api/mesh/session (the TWO named write carve-outs, below), and a clean
// not-found for everything else.
//
// milestone 50 / story 02 (ADR-001 + ADR-006) — the write surface grows from ONE
// named route to TWO: POST /api/mesh/session dispatches a bare session-spawn
// directive to a worker. It is a deliberate, ENUMERATED expansion of the bound, not
// a relaxation: `acd-mesh-ui-write-isolation` now names BOTH routes and still fires
// on any third unenumerated one. The new route writes no file and shells out to
// nothing either — it pushes ONE relay envelope, exactly as the terminal-input lane
// already does from this same process.
//
// milestone 38 / story 04 (ADR-012) — the face gains its FIRST live write
// route: POST /api/mesh/assign wraps the EXISTING `assignWork` verb VERBATIM
// (`./commands/mesh-assign.mjs`), same-origin + application/json admitted
// (SECURITY T13), re-running every one of the verb's own gates — no second
// arbitration, no bespoke uniqueness/repo check. This is the SOLE, deliberate,
// documented exception to the isolation guarantees below.
//
// milestone 38 / story 04 — ADR-012 AMENDMENT (2026-07-24, BLOCKER F21): the
// write route's WIRE SHAPE is `{ ref, nodeId, workspaceId }`, all three
// REQUIRED, and it resolves the ref against the ITEM's OWN workspace (through
// the sanctioned queryGlobalMeshStatus → status.workspaces[] → projectRoot
// seam) — NEVER against `resolvedProjectDir`, this daemon's own launch dir.
// The face is GLOBAL, so resolving a per-item fact from its own local context
// mis-dispatched real work off a `200 ok` (the ADR-010 "Gap A" class).
//
// The isolation guarantees are otherwise STRUCTURAL:
//   - it imports the single global query surface plus the board launcher, not
//     low-level work/run/mesh writers — PLUS the one `assignWork` verb door;
//   - it stands up exactly ONE `http.createServer` bound to `127.0.0.1`, routing
//     the fleet under `/api/mesh*` and NEVER `/api/work*`;
//   - it performs ZERO fs write and NO shell-out of its own (the ONE mutation
//     rides entirely inside `assignWork`'s own gated store write); it serves no
//     `/ws/terminal`; every OTHER route/method stays read-only.
//
// milestone 28 / story 00 (ADR-003): the default ui/dist location routes
// through the ONE SEA-safe asset-base seam instead of joining a path off a bare
// import.meta.url — dev behaviour is byte-for-byte unchanged (a caller-supplied
// repoRoot still wins, exactly as before; only the DEFAULT resolution changes
// carrier). A packaged binary reads the sidecar ui/dist tree instead.
//
