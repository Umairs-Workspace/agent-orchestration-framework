// src/mesh/assignment.mjs — the ASSIGN/WITHDRAW cores (milestone 35 / story 00,
// ADR-001/003), below the command layer.
//
// They live here rather than in commands/mesh-assign.mjs (m42 wave (d) leg d1)
// because the fleet UI server calls `assignWork` directly and a src-root module
// reaching UP into commands/ was one of the four upward imports the layer gate now
// forbids — and routing that server through the registry instead would have made
// mesh-ui-serve.mjs and commands/mesh-ui.mjs a NEW cycle. The command keeps the
// verb (its face, its refusal matrix, its thrown coded errors); this module keeps
// the behaviour. Moved verbatim — no behaviour change.
//
// It resolves the ref EXACTLY (`findWork`, work.mjs), mints a first-class
// `assigned` record in `global_assignments` (ADR-001), enforces the store-
// uniqueness single-runner invariant (ADR-003 — at most one ACTIVE assignment per
// (workspaceId, itemRef)), and checks the control-side repo-availability gate (this
// node's target must actually HOLD the workspace's published repo, resolved via
// `global_node_workspaces` + `mesh.repo.published`, mirroring mesh-repo-marker.mjs's
// own read of that marker).
//
// Arbitration is a plain store query — no lease/issuance/sync module, no git read
// (ADR-003 / acd-assignment-arbitration-store-not-git). Every miss is a CODED, loud
// refusal (34/ADR-008) that mints nothing; nothing here silently returns.
