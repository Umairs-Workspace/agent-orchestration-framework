// The same-origin board server (finding F-1).
//
// The board's API calls are same-origin relative paths (ui/src/board/api.ts →
// fetch("/api/work/list")) and the terminal WS URL is built from
// window.location.host (ui/src/board/TerminalDock.tsx). So the board page MUST be
// served from ONE origin that also routes /api/work* and /ws/terminal. The single
// serveSetupUi server already routes all three on one port; this helper points it
// at the BUILT bundle (ui/dist) — not the vite-only dev source — and refuses to
// fall back to source when the build is missing.
//
// milestone 28 / story 00 (ADR-003): the default ui/dist location routes through
// the ONE SEA-safe asset-base seam instead of joining a path off a bare
// import.meta.url — dev behaviour is byte-for-byte unchanged (a caller-supplied
// repoRoot still wins, exactly as before; only the DEFAULT resolution changes
// carrier). A packaged binary reads the sidecar ui/dist tree instead.
//
// Original aof code (adapts nothing from vibeyard) — no attribution needed.
