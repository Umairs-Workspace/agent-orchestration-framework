// src/claude-settings.mjs — the CO-AUTHORED settings writer (milestone 43 / ADR-002).
//
// `.claude/settings.json` is hand-maintained by an operator: ~140 possible top-level
// keys, five independently hand-wired hook events, `permissions.deny`,
// `sandbox.filesystem`, `enabledPlugins`, `extraKnownMarketplaces`. A whole-file
// render builds the body from `config.hooks` + `config.settings` and NOTHING ELSE, so
// it deletes every one of them. That is m42 leg d4's `writeLock` defect verbatim —
// one writer assuming sole ownership of a document with several authors.
//
// THE RULE, ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE CODEBASE (ADR-002): a whole-file render (bundle
// manifest, content-hashed, drift-protected) is correct IFF aof exclusively owns the
// file. A file with any other author gets a SURGICAL MERGE. So the hook SCRIPT ships
// as a bundle asset (aof owns it outright) and the hook ENTRY ships through here.
//
// The merge mirrors `mergeLock` (lock.mjs) and `writeSidecarPatch`
// (node-identity.mjs), including the latter's skip-the-write-when-unchanged
// refinement — with the two things neither precedent needed:
//
//   1. THE TARGET IS THREE LEVELS DEEP. Not "one top-level key" but one hook ARRAY
//      ENTRY, inside one EVENT key, inside one TOP-LEVEL key. An operator entry on
//      the same event survives beside aof's, in its original position.
//   2. AOF'S ENTRIES ARE SELF-IDENTIFYING (ADR-010/R3.E: a marker KEY on the entry
//      object, not a sentinel argv element — argv is content an operator may
//      legitimately edit). Without a marker the merge cannot tell its own entry from
//      an operator's on the next run and would either duplicate every run or clobber
//      a sibling. With one the splice is idempotent AND retractable: removing the
//      hook from config removes exactly aof's entry and nothing else.
//
// TORN READS REFUSE (ADR-010/R3.A, which SUPERSEDES ADR-002's "absent/torn ⇒ {}"):
// absent-⇒-{} is safe only because `mergeLock`'s subject is aof-owned. For a
// co-authored file, answering one missing brace by replacing the operator's document
// with a three-line aof-only one is the exact defect this module exists to close,
// arriving through its own fallback. ABSENT ⇒ `{}` (a genuine fresh install); TORN ⇒
// the coded `claude-settings-unparseable`, writing NOTHING.
//
// WHITESPACE. Like both precedents, the writer re-serialises the whole document with
// `JSON.stringify(_, null, 2)`. Every operator VALUE survives byte-identical; a file
// whose hand-authored layout is more compact is normalised the first time a real
// change is written (and never otherwise — an unchanged merge writes nothing at all).

// makes `node` itself exit non-zero, defeating the enqueue script's "exit 0, always" from
// OUTSIDE the script. Forward slashes, because a Windows-written entry has to spawn on the
// Mac and WSL workers too.
//
// A BARE checkout-relative argv does NOT work, contrary to this comment's first version:
// the harness does NOT resolve a relative argv against the project directory. It spawns the
// hook with the session's PERSISTED SHELL CWD, so after any `cd` into a subdirectory the
// path misses and node exits MODULE_NOT_FOUND. That surfaces as a `hook_non_blocking_error`
// — NON-blocking, so the tool call proceeds and the hook silently does nothing. Measured
// 2026-08-06 across real installs (vista-app-web, willow-shield-portal): 37 such misses,
// from cwds like `<root>/packages/application/`. `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}` is substituted by
// the harness into BOTH `command` and every `args` element before the spawn, so it stays
// correct in every checkout and every worktree while never writing an absolute path into
// the tracked file. It also makes `process.argv[1]` absolute, which is what the enqueue
// script's `<root>/.claude/hooks/aof/<this>` -> `<root>/.aof/` walk needs to land the queue
// at the project root instead of relative to whatever cwd the hook inherited.
//
// The durable class, bigger than this milestone: anything aof writes into a TRACKED

// it for me" is an assumption to MEASURE, not to assume.
