// src/work/content-read.mjs — the WORKER-side content read (schema v5, TECH_DEBT
// item 6), widened to the ADR-007 artifact manifest by milestone 43 / story 03.
//
// WHY IT IS ITS OWN MODULE. It lived in `global-work-store.mjs` until this story.
// ADR-012/B4 put a line ceiling on that module precisely so the NEXT block lands in a
// module of its own and is CALLED from the store rather than added to it — this is
// that ruling applied to the first block that arrived after it. The move is
// structural only: the function's signature, its row shapes and its absent/error
// discipline are byte-unchanged, and its one caller (`global-work-publisher.mjs`,
// which re-exports it for the launcher) now imports it from here.
//
// ADR-005 category (b): a WORKER reading its own materialized worktree is the
// intended behaviour and must never be migrated onto the control's cache — that would
// make a worker read someone else's opinion of its own checkout. It therefore keeps
// importing `work.mjs`'s disk readers, deliberately.

// readWorkspaceContentRecords(workspace, { itemRef }) — for every item in the
// workspace that belongs to `itemRef`'s subtree (the item, its milestone, the
// milestone's children — the SAME scoping rule the worktree delta rows use), collect
// the requestable artifact bodies (the ADR-007 MANIFEST: 8 exact filenames plus every
// `.feature` member of `tasks/`) and the item's run records (run-store's own reader,
// so a streamed record is byte-identical to a local read). Each artifact carries its
// own CONTENT hash, which is what lets the tick send only what actually moved
// (ADR-007/AC8). A missing file is absent-not-error (skipped); any OTHER read fault
// lands in `errors` for the caller to report — never swallowed, never fatal to the
// rest of the read.
// `items` is an OPTIONAL already-enumerated item list (ADR-013's health finding: the
// tick walked `listItems` twice per worktree per tick — once for the drain's path
// attribution and again in here). Absent, the read enumerates for itself, so every
// existing caller is byte-unchanged.
