// `aof work update` — re-render the shipped ACD bundle against a consumer repo's
// install manifest and on-disk files (milestone 01 / story 02). The SYMMETRIC
// TWIN of `aof work init`: a THIN orchestrator over the existing engine.
//
//   ADR-003: update does NOT implement its own create/update/skip/drift/delete or
//     a `--force` comparison. It synthesizes the SAME aof `config` init does (the
//     shared synthesis in work-bundle-synthesis.mjs) and delegates to
//     createRenderPlan → planApplyActions(previousLock = the install manifest) →
//     executeApplyActions → createLockManifest. (Guarded by acd-reuses-render-plan.)
//   ADR-004 → ADR-009: the per-repo install manifest is the `work` SECTION of the
//     SINGLE unified project lock `.aof/aof.lock.json` (workspacePaths().lockPath) —
//     the separate per-vertical work-lock file is eliminated. update reads the
//     unified lock, passes the `work` SECTION (its recorded `files[]`) to
//     planApplyActions as `previousLock` for the drift-check, rebuilds the `work`
//     manifest, and writes `{ ...currentLock, work: <manifest> }` — preserving the
//     flat asset fields and the `planning` section, never reconstructing from a
//     fixed field set. The no-manifest guard keys off ABSENCE of `lock.work`.
//     (Guarded by acd-install-manifest-contract, section form.)
//   ADR-005: drift detection is the engine's: a managed file whose hash diverges
//     from the manifest classifies as `drift-warning` and is preserved, never
//     overwritten without --force. (Guarded by acd-no-clobber-without-force.)
//   ADR-006: cross-runtime mapping is delegated to the CAPABILITIES matrix via the
//     shared synthesis — no `runtime === "codex"`/`"claude"` installability branch
//     lives here. (Guarded by acd-capability-delegation.)
