// src/work/artifacts.mjs — THE artifact set (milestone 43 / ADR-007).
//
// The set a worker STREAMS for its active worktree and the set a face may REQUEST
// by name are the same set, and this module is its one home. That invariant is not
// new — it is what `WORK_ITEM_DOC_FILES`' own comment claimed in
// `global-work-store.mjs` — but the widening (`tasks/*.feature`, ARCHITECTURE.md,
// DESIGN.md, RESEARCH.md, STATE.md) is exactly the moment a second literal list gets
// written by accident, so the constant moves here and `WORK_ITEM_DOC_FILES` becomes a
// DERIVED compatibility view over it. (`acd-work-artifact-set-single-home`.)
//
// TWO KINDS, AND NO THIRD:
//   { name, file }      an exact filename, requested by NAME.
//   { name, dir, ext }  a bounded directory + extension, requested by NAME + MEMBER.
// A glob/regex language is REJECTED (ADR-007): `work:doc`'s input contract is a name,
// so "what can I ask for" has to stay answerable. A pattern language is precisely how
// the streamed set and the requestable set would drift apart.
//
// A PURE LEAF (0 repo imports, `node:crypto` only). Its three consumers — the
// worker's content read, `commands/doc.mjs` and the drain — must not travel through
// `global-work-store.mjs`'s import closure to read a constant table. Separator
// handling is hand-rolled rather than `node:path`'s because a path spelled on a
// Windows node has to normalise identically when this module runs on Linux (the
// drain de-duplicates `/` against `\`, task 01), and posix `path` does not split on
// a backslash at all.
import { createHash } from "node:crypto";

// THE MANIFEST. Order is the streaming/enumeration order.
