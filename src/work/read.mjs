// src/work/read.mjs — THE CACHE-FIRST READ SEAM (milestone 43 / story 06, ADR-005).
//
// THE DISEASE, in the milestone's own recorded words (43/03's accept note, from a live
// two-node run): "`aof work list` on the control still answers from the control's own disk,
// so it did not show the worker-authored stories during the run." A worker builds an item
// in its own worktree, streams it into the cache, finishes and deletes the worktree — and
// the control node, which never held anything but the pre-run scaffold, goes on answering
// from that scaffold forever. Every control-side read command had the same disease because
// every one of them read the same disk.
//
// THE CURE, and its shape. This module exposes cache-first equivalents of `work.mjs`'s four
// disk readers — `listItems` / `findWork` / `nextWork` / `listStream` — each answering from
// the cache where the cache can answer, falling back to this node's disk where it cannot,
// and stamping EVERY returned row with which side answered it.
//
// THE DEPENDENCY DIRECTION IS FIXED AND IS THE WHOLE BOUNDARY: this module imports
// `work.mjs`; `work.mjs` NEVER imports this one. That is m41/ADR-001's rule reused verbatim
// and for the same reason — `src/work.mjs` is the 37-importer god-node, so a new capability
// lives BESIDE it, consuming its readers, never inside it. `acd-cache-read-surface-boundary`
// holds both halves, and it also holds the OTHER half of the boundary POSITIVELY: the
// worker-side reads and the structural (rename/insert/upgrade/doctor) reads must KEEP
// importing the disk readers. A worker that read the control's opinion of its own checkout
// would close a loop in which the mesh observes nothing; a rename that ran against a set
// that is not the set on disk would renumber folders that are not there.
//
// FOUR RULES THIS MODULE EXISTS TO KEEP, each of which a plausible implementation breaks:
//
//   1. CACHE-FIRST, NEVER CACHE-ONLY. A control node that has never published — a fresh
//      workspace, a torn store, a single-machine install that has no mesh at all — must
//      still answer. A read seam that could refuse to answer would be strictly worse than
//      the disk reader it replaces.
//   2. THE DEGRADE IS REPORTED, NOT SILENT. Falling back is a designed path, and it says so
//      on the durable degrade sink — once per coded class per read, never once per row (a
//      hot read loop must not turn the sink into the noise it exists to replace).
//   3. EVERY ROW SAYS WHICH SIDE ANSWERED IT. `answeredFrom` is "cache" or "disk" on every
//      row this module returns. A cache-answered row also carries `reportedBy` + `syncedAt`
//      (43/04's wire names, through 43/04's one mapper). A disk-answered row carries NEITHER
//      — an unobserved freshness is never fabricated, and "never cache-published" is a
//      different fact from "cache-published, author unknown" (which does carry both keys,
//      explicitly null).
//   4. NO PATH IS EVER FABRICATED. A cache-answered row for a ref this node does not hold
//      carries `dir: null` (ADR-010/R6.4). Every reader that reaches THROUGH a row into its
//      folder must therefore handle null — refuse coded at a WRITE door, skip-and-count at
//      an indexer, mark-and-report at a read door — and never guess a path.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: it re-derives none of `work.mjs`'s rules. The query-match rule, the
// depth-first stream order and the whole `nextWork` candidacy walk stay in exactly one
// place; this module builds a merged VIEW in `work.mjs`'s own vocabulary and hands it back
// through the optional `view` seam. "Two definitions of what is next" would be the defect
// this milestone has already been burned by in four other shapes.
import { listItems, findWork, listStream, nextWork } from "../work.mjs";
// The node's read of the shared cache (rows + per-row provenance, already through
// cache-provenance.mjs's ONE storage→wire mapper). Null means the cache cannot answer at
// all, which is a different fact from an empty answer.
import { readCachedItemRows } from "../cache-read.mjs";
// m42 item 3 — "errors are events, not silence". ADR-005's degrade is EXPLICIT, and this is
// the channel that makes it so; `reportDegrade` throttles per code, which is precisely rule 2.
import { reportDegrade } from "../degrade.mjs";
// THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BOUNDARY (see `isMeshWorktree` below). The three predicates are
// the ONE definitions of the assignment, session and local-dispatch roots and are reused
// rather than re-spelled — the module they come from is a near-leaf (node builtins plus
// the degrade sink), so nothing heavy is dragged into a read.

//   · UNAVAILABLE — this node has no usable cache for this workspace at all (never
//     published, torn, no identity). EVERY row degraded; the mesh is not answering here.
//   · MISS — the cache is answering, but it holds no row for some of the refs in this read.
//     Ordinary on a healthy mesh (a local item nobody has published yet), and worth one
//     line rather than none, because a read that quietly half-degrades is how a stale answer
//     gets mistaken for an authoritative one.

// needs real files under a row's `dir` stepped over a row that has none. Reported rather
// than swallowed, because "this node indexed/swept fewer items than the stream contains" is

// ------------------------------------------------------------ the boundary ----

// isMeshWorktree(projectRoot) — is THIS workspace a materialised mesh worktree?
//
// THE ECHO CHAMBER, CLOSED AT ITS ONE REMAINING DOOR (ADR-005's worker-side clause). The
// worker's EXECUTION reads go through `work.mjs` directly and are pinned there by
// `acd-cache-read-surface-boundary` — but a control-side COMMAND run inside a worktree
// (`aof work find`, `aof work list`) reaches this seam, and a per-assignment worktree reports
// under the SAME workspace id as the control. Without this check, `aof work find` inside a
// worker's own checkout answered with ANOTHER NODE'S OPINION of the work that checkout is
// currently authoring — precisely the closed loop the boundary exists to prevent, arriving
// through the command layer instead of the execution layer. MEASURED, not theorised: with the
// worktree's workspace id pinned as production pins it, the seam returned the cache's
// `in-progress` over the worktree's own freshly-authored `done`.
//
// The shape is the signal and it is a LOCAL one: a materialised worktree lives under one
// of the assignment/session/dispatch roots owned by mesh-worktree.mjs. Four levels up from
// any candidate is the origin root those roots are built from, so their existing predicates
// answer the question without a second spelling of any path convention.
//
// A worktree therefore reads its OWN disk, always, and every row it returns says `disk`. That
// is not a degrade — nothing failed — so nothing is written to the degrade sink; the honest
// report is the per-row stamp itself.
//
// EXPORTED, and that is the ruling rather than a convenience (m43 / ADR-016/G4, MEASURED).
// This started as a module-private helper, which made "is this workspace a materialised mesh
// worktree?" a property of THIS READER instead of a fact about the workspace — so it closed
// the seam's door and left every OTHER cache-read door open. `src/commands/doctor.mjs` calls
// `readCachedWorkFacts` directly, and inside a worker's own worktree that produced
// `cache-status-divergence` on every item whose disk had moved past the last stream tick (the
// normal mid-phase state), plus a knock-on `started-story-no-tasks` off the overlaid status.
// The general rule this pays for: A GUARD THAT ANSWERS A QUESTION ABOUT THE WORKSPACE BELONGS
// WHERE EVERY CONSUMER OF THAT WORKSPACE CAN REACH IT. One home for the predicate; each door
// applies it where its own read happens.

// archived row's flag was never rebuilt, so a remote `next` could propose a driver the owning
// node had put away. The store carries both facts now (`backlog`'s PRESENCE is what `number:
// null` derives from — `""` is the top of the backlog and is a string; `archived: true` rides
// as itself), and the rebuilt item is the enumerator's own row for that root: a backlog leaf
// is `{ number: null, …, parent: null, backlog }`, an archived row is the numbered shape plus
// `archived: true`, and every other row is byte-identical to before. `name` and `dir` stay
// null on all three — a backlog leaf's folder name is as absent here as a numbered one's.

//     43/02's renumber regression is exactly what a cache row parked at an old ref looks
//     like — letting it re-name a local folder's item would propagate that fault into

//   · `depends` is a gate this node can read perfectly well from its own disk, and losing
//     it to a status overlay would make a migrated `next` stop honouring gates.
// This is `mergeWorkerItems`' rule ("the worker's status/title win; the row keeps its local
// dir"), applied one layer down so every reader inherits it rather than the board alone.
