// `aof session ping` fires on EVERY prompt an operator types, writes a small record and exits. What
// it used to cost was the entire command surface: importing `./command-core.mjs` pulls all 88
// command modules, and that one import measured 324–351 ms of this file's 363–384 ms — against
// 150 ms for the whole process when only the session module is loaded. `./spine/face.mjs` goes with
// it for the same reason and no other: it reaches the registry, and it measures the same.
// `./work.mjs` STAYS static — 16 ms, and moving it would be churn dressed as a fix.
//
// Measured: dropping these two takes this file's static closure from 277 modules to 31.
//
// A LAZY IMPORT IS ONLY HALF THE FIX, and the other half is WHERE it sits. Deferring the registry
// behind `await import()` satisfies a closure walk and changes nothing at runtime if the hot path
// then awaits it — the same 88 modules, the same milliseconds, a different spelling. So the session
// arm is the FIRST statement of `run()` below, above every registry use including `helpText()`,
// which is itself registry-derived. FF-7205 asserts both halves.
//
// `getCommand` / `listCommands` / `resolveRoute` / `runCommandFace` are therefore imported at their
// use sites, each of which sits below that arm.

// setDelegationModelCommand / showDelegation / updateWork — no longer imported

// trio (work:orchestrator / work:delegation / work:delegation-model) is
// registered in commands/orchestrator-delegation.mjs, riding the route table.
// serveBoard / serveStdio / the vite dev spawn — no longer imported here (m42
// wave (d) leg d1, wave-3 tail): the work:ui / graph:serve / assets:ui launch
// bodies own them in their command modules (the launcher seam).
// serveMeshUi + the fleet mirror/relay wiring — no longer imported here (m42

// meshRepoCommand / meshAssignCommand / meshRecoverPushCommand — RETIRED (m42
// wave (d) leg d1, wave-3 tail): mesh:repo-publish / mesh:assign /
// mesh:recover-push are registered Commands in their own modules
// (commands/mesh-repo.mjs, mesh-assign.mjs, mesh-recover-push.mjs), riding the
// route table + the ONE generic face. The repo no-verb/unknown-verb shim lives
// in meshCommand; recover-push's pre-invoke progress line and its json-exit-0
// on coded failure are documented in WAVE-D-MIGRATION.md.

// meshServeDaemonCommand — RETIRED (m42 wave (d) leg d1, wave-3 tail part 2,
// the launcher seam): the `--serve` daemon body is mesh:serve's cli.launch
// (src/commands/mesh-serve.mjs); the route table carries both spellings and
// the face's probe rule keeps `--json` non-blocking.
// meshDesktopCommand — RETIRED (same change): mesh:desktop-install /
// mesh:desktop-run are registered three-word routes (commands/mesh-desktop.mjs);
// only the no-verb/unknown-verb shim remains in meshCommand.

// workOrchestratorCommand / workDelegationCommand / workDelegationModelCommand —
// RETIRED (m42 wave (d) leg d1, the CLI-only batch closing half): the
// model-config trio is registered in commands/orchestrator-delegation.mjs on
// the route table. The prompts (the orchestrator-model picker, its
// AOF_ORCHESTRATOR_INPUT seam intact) moved into the async argv adapters; the
// prints into collector-fed renders; a bad --model is refused pre-write.

// workUseHeadroomCommand / workUnuseHeadroomCommand — RETIRED (m42 wave (d)
// leg d1, wave-3 tail): work:use-headroom / work:unuse-headroom are registered
// Commands (commands/headroom.mjs) on the route table; the cores' install hint
// rides the result as `notes` so the render reproduces the transcript and the
// --json face stays one document.

// workInitCommand / workUpdateCommand — RETIRED (m42 wave (d) leg d1,
// wave-3 tail): work:init / work:update are registered Commands
// (commands/init-update.mjs) on the route table (pure-outcome idiom; the
// guarded/not-initialised refusal message now ends the stdout document — the
// packages:install normalisation precedent — with cli.exit gating 1; the
// --json refusal doc keeps its retired shape).

// workMemoryCommandCli — RETIRED (story 128): the memory shim went with the ladder branch above.

// `aof planning <sub>` — `init` MIGRATED (m42 wave (d) leg d1, the CLI-only
// batch closing half): planning:init is a registered Command
// (commands/planning-init.mjs) on the route table; the printing core's log is
// a collector there, and the refusal message now ends the stdout document (the
// packages:install normalisation precedent). Only an unknown subcommand ever
// reaches this shim.

}

// workFindCommand — RETIRED (m42 wave (d) leg d1, wave-3 tail): work:find is a
// registered Command (commands/find.mjs) on the route table — the bare-array
// --json document and the no-match stdout+exit-1 read-miss are carried
// contracts (--json stays [] at exit 0).

// workListCommand / workValidateCommand / workDoctorCommand / workNextCommand /
// workFeedbackCommand / the run-verb wrappers + runVerbCli / workInsertCli —
// RETIRED (m42 wave (d) leg d1, wave 2): every one of these verbs carries
// cli.route + cli.spec and dispatches through the route table + the ONE
// generic face (src/spine/face.mjs), whose --json single-envelope discipline
// (incl. the insert family's shifted count) IS these faces' one home.

// workObserveCommand — RETIRED (m42 wave (d) leg d1, wave-3 tail): work:observe
// is a registered Command (commands/observe.mjs) on the route table. Documented
// change: a skipped `--if-enabled --json` run now emits ONE { skipped: true }
// document (previously nothing — the one-document discipline).


// initCommand / guideAfterInit / writeInstallLock — RETIRED (m42 wave (d) leg
// d1, the CLI-only batch closing half): `aof init` is the registered
// project:init command (commands/project-init.mjs) on the one-word route. The
// interactive selectRuntimes completion lives in its async argv adapter (the
// assets:add precedent); the guards throw CODED refusals from run() with the
// retired messages; the lock seed moved with it (still wholesale — the d4
// writeLock read-merge item is untouched).

// assetsListCommand — RETIRED (m42 wave (d) leg d1): now the registered
// assets:list command (src/commands/assets-list.mjs), routed through the
// generic face. Byte-identical output; flag vocabulary declared on the command.

// printValidationResult — RETIRED (m42 wave (d) leg d1): the shared report
// lives in src/commands/validate-shared.mjs (renderValidationReport).

// assetsApplyCommand — RETIRED (m42 wave (d) leg d1): now the registered
// assets:apply command (src/commands/assets-apply.mjs), routed through the
// generic face. Byte-identical output; runtimesForApply moved with it, the
// friendly-action/marker/display helpers to render-plan.mjs.

// assetsUiCommand / setupUiCommand / startSetupUiFrontend — RETIRED (m42 wave
// (d) leg d1, wave-3 tail, the launcher seam): `aof assets ui` is the
// registered assets:ui command (commands/assets-ui.mjs) — probe run +
// cli.launch editor body — on the route table; the DEV-ONLY vite re-exec (the
// acd-sea-safe-asset-base allow-list note) moved with it.

// packagesListCommand — RETIRED (m42 wave (d) leg d1): now the registered
// packages:list command (src/commands/packages-list.mjs), routed through the
// generic face. Byte-identical output; packageSummaries moved to packages.mjs.

// packagesInstallCommand — RETIRED (m42 wave (d) leg d1): now the registered
// packages:install command (src/commands/packages-install.mjs), routed through
// the generic face; the frameworkInstall/installFromLock machinery moved with
// it. Byte-identical transcript; the failure summary now ends the stdout
// document (the exit rides cli.exit).

// projectShowCommand — RETIRED (m42 wave (d) leg d1): now the registered
// project:show command (src/commands/project-show.mjs), routed through the
// generic face (bare `aof project` delegates to the same command above).

// frameworkInstallCommand / installFromLockCommand — RETIRED (m42 wave (d)
// leg d1): the machinery lives in src/commands/packages-install.mjs.

// packageSummaries — moved to src/packages.mjs (m42 wave (d) leg d1: command
// logic leaves the face file). interactiveInstallCommand — DELETED with the
// packages:install migration (dead code: zero callers).

// parseOptions + its global boolean allow-list, printJson — DELETED (m42 wave
// (d) leg d1, the CLI-only batch closing half — the d1 end-state): every
// registered verb's flag vocabulary is its OWN cli.spec, parsed by
// parseSpecArgv in the one generic face; the last callers (init / planning
// init / the model-config trio / meshCommand's usage scan) migrated or moved
// to the shims' token-scan idiom. A typo'd flag can no longer silently become
// a stringly option anywhere in the CLI.
