// src/board-mesh-execution.mjs — the board's MESH-EXECUTION overlay (VERIFICATION,
// live two-machine soak 2026-07-25).
//
// THE DEFECT, reported by the operator: the board (`?mode=board#18`) showed a milestone
// as "not started" while a worker node was actively executing it — and kept saying so
// after it completed. The board's read path is `work:list` → `listStream` → `readMeta`,
// i.e. the CONTROL node's OWN local record-doc frontmatter. That local checkout never ran
// the work (a worker on another machine did, on its own branch), so its frontmatter is
// genuinely `not-started`: the board was reporting the local truth to a question about a
// remote one. The projection's `work_items.status` is no better here — the worker streams
// its MAIN checkout, and the advancement lives on the per-item mesh BRANCH.
//
// THE OPERATOR'S OWN THREE STEPS, built here verbatim:
//   1. is this item currently being EXECUTED? — an ACTIVE assignment row for it
//      (assigned/accepted/running) in `global_assignments`;
//   2. if so, show THAT — the executing node, the lifecycle state, the session (so the
//      terminal view is one click away) and the mesh BRANCH the work actually lives on,
//      plus an honest `in-progress` status while a worker is genuinely RUNNING it;
//   3. if no execution data can be found, DEFAULT TO LOCAL — the row passes through
//      byte-identical, which is also what every non-mesh workspace and the plain CLI get.
//
// It is a READ-ONLY overlay over rows the board already produces: it never writes, never
// mutates a record doc, and any fault (no store, an unreadable projection, a workspace
// that was never published) degrades to step 3 rather than failing the board.

//
// Runs, assignments, branches and worktrees are all recorded against the TOP-LEVEL item
// (the milestone): a mesh run of "18" builds its stories inside ONE worktree on ONE
// branch. A child ref therefore has no execution row of its own — and every consumer
// that looked up the overlay by exact ref got "never ran" for "18/02" while its
// milestone was running on another machine. The continue door then fell through to
// "here" and started a rival local run: the exact one-door defect, one level down.
//
// The scope rule has ONE home and it is `src/assignment-record.mjs` (m43/ADR-003 —
// it is an assignment-record concern by subject, "which item ref does an assignment
// cover", and a pure leaf is the only home both this face and the mint seam can
// reach without inverting the layering). It is RE-EXPORTED here so this module's
// consumers — the continue decision (src/commands/continue.mjs), run-status'
// streamed-run lookup, and the row overlay (applyExecutionOverlay, below) — keep
// importing it from where they always have, and so "what the board shows on the
// story", "where the story's continue goes" and "what the mint door refuses" can
// never disagree.
