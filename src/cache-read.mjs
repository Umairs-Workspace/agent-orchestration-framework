// src/cache-read.mjs — THIS NODE'S READ OF THE SHARED WORK CACHE (renamed 119/01, ADR-005 §5;
// TECH_DEBT item 10's trigger, "the tenth dependent or the src/mesh/ partition, whichever comes
// first", fired on both).
//
// THE SUBJECT IS THE CACHE, and the worker's view is ONE INSTANCE of it. The module was born as
// `board-worker-stream.mjs` for the first face that read it, and its readers have since spanned
// both layers — seven spine (the read seam and the `doc`, `list`, `tasks`, `continue`,
// `run-status` and `doctor` commands) and two mesh (`mesh/launcher.mjs`,
// `commands/mesh-heartbeat.mjs`). A name that asserts a face its readers contradict is 43/ADR-016's
// shape, which is why this one names what it reads rather than who first read it. It contains no
// render and no HTTP, and it sits at the root of `src/` rather than in either layer's directory
// for the same reason.
//
// The exported names are NOT part of the rename: `readWorkerItems` / `readWorkerRuns` are named for
// the AUTHORITY that streamed the rows, which is still the worker. Neither is the degrade CODE
// this module emits: `reportDegrade("board-worker-stream", …)` keeps its spelling deliberately.
// A degrade code is an EMITTED identifier in a diagnostic vocabulary, not a path — changing it
// would be the one behaviour change in a story whose whole claim is that it makes none.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS MODULE WAS BORN FOR: the board lists the CONTROL node's own checkout, so an item a worker is
// building on another machine showed its pre-run scaffold — "not started · 0 stories" over
// a milestone the agent had already broken into seven stories.
//
// WHERE THE TRUTH COMES FROM — the WORKER, over the fabric, and nothing else. The worker
// streams the work-state of the WORKTREE it is actually working in (mesh-launcher's
// pushActiveWorktreeState → sendDelta → control's applyDeltaFrame → the global
// projection's work_items), continuously, while it works. This module reads THAT.
//
// EXPLICITLY NOT THE GIT BRANCH. A branch only exists once a run has committed and pushed,
// so branch-reading cannot show work in flight and makes committing a precondition for
// visibility — the board would still be blind for the entire duration of a run, which is
// exactly the window an operator is watching. The worker is the authority on its own work;
// the projection is how that authority reaches this node.

// reader in this file opens the projection through `withProjectionStore` and closes it again,
// which is right for a single read and wrong for a loop: the launcher's presence tick calls
// `listItemsCacheFirst` per workspace and `readCachedActiveRunIds` per workspace, so the tick
// cost went from one disk scan to 2N SQLite opens. Measured on the daemon's hot loop, with a
// ONE-workspace, EMPTY-store fixture, that alone pushed the presence refresh from ~13ms to
// ~22ms and turned `mesh-coordination-launcher/03` red against its 25ms budget. THE STORE IS
// ONE FILE FOR EVERY WORKSPACE (`withProjectionStore` keys on `globalMeshPaths(options)`), so
// a batch that opens it more than once is paying N times for the same handle.
//
// The handle handed to each read has a NO-OP `close()` — the BATCH owns the lifetime, and
// `withProjectionStore`'s always-close `finally` must not tear down a store its siblings are
// still using. The open is LAZY (a tick that resolves no workspace opens nothing) and
// memoised on the PROMISE, so a failed open is a single failure the whole batch degrades
// through rather than N retries; each read then sees `withProjectionStore`'s ordinary
// degrade-to-null, exactly as it would have on its own.
