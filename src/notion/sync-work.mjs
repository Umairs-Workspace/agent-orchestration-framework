// src/notion/sync-work.mjs — the ONE milestone-sync body (m42 wave (d) leg d4,
// port 4). This core is the whole of "sync an aof milestone (+ its stories) to
// its Notion board": the opt-in no-op gate (17/ADR-004), the shared
// listItems/readMeta traversal, the routing resolution (18/ADR-003), the sidecar
// read (ADR-001), the pure projection plan and its apply. It moved here FROM
// commands/notion-sync-work.mjs so the sync-work VERB and the effects ledger's
// `notion-status-sync` reactor share one body — the reactor could not import the
// command (src/* never reaches back into commands/, acd-command-layer-imports-
// downward), and a second copy of the sync would be m42's own disease.
//
// The command keeps the FACE (input schema, argv/render/json, the owed-step
// drain); this core owns the decision + egress. It reaches Notion ONLY through
// the injectable spawn seam (`notionSpawn`, defaulting to the provisioned-CLI
// spawn built from the resolved config), so a test injects a spy and asserts
// dry-run / no-op / skip paths call it ZERO times.
