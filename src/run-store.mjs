// src/run-store.mjs — the run-record store, the state-machine validator, the
// runs/ path seam, and (milestone 20) the RESILIENCE spine: failure
// classification + attempt ceiling, the retry-lineage mint, the heartbeat +
// restart-time orphan-reclaim scan, the dedup guard + collision-safe mint, and the
// atomic persist. The SPINE the run commands and the autonomous skill all couple
// through (milestone 19 story 00; extended by milestone 20 story 00).
//
// A RUN is a first-class, durably-recorded entity distinct from the durable work
// ITEM (the PRD "Issue != Task" mechanic). Each run is its OWN JSON file, named by
// its runId, under the item's runs/ directory (ARCHITECTURE 19/ADR-002; the
// node-partitioned shape is 26/ADR-001 — the m22-frozen convention made real):
//
//   wiki/work/NN_type_slug/runs/<run-id>.json                       — a milestone's runs (flat / single-node)
//   wiki/work/NN…/stories/SS_story_…/runs/<run-id>.json             — a story's runs (its OWN folder)
//   wiki/work/NN…/runs/<node>/<run-id>.json                         — a node-partitioned run (26/ADR-001)
//
// The runs/ log is DERIVED (19/ADR-002): rebuildable (the dir is wholly
// regenerable), prunable (delete a file ⇒ prune a run), and — as of milestone 26 —
// node-PARTITIONED: 19's promised <node>/ segment landed as the additive
// runNodeRecordPath builder, the record's one additive `node` key decides placement
// (record → path, never path → record on write), and every reader sees the UNION of
// flat entries + one level of node subdirs. The node id arrives as DATA (a mint
// option / record key) — this store reads no config and imports no mesh module. Item
// frontmatter status stays the single source of truth — this store NEVER writes a
// record doc; every write joins runsDir(item) (the write-scope guard). That guard
// is why this module references ZERO record-doc filename (SPEC.md/STORY.md/STATE.md/
// SESSION.md): record-doc resolution lives in work.mjs, never here. The status
// rollback a reclaim triggers is the work.mjs writer the COMMAND layer calls over
// reclaimStaleRuns's return value — never written from inside this store (20/ADR-005).

// (the genuine 23 → 20 seam — never a parallel heartbeat, the SPEC §Dependencies
