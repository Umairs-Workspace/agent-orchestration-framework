// src/degrade.mjs — "errors are events, not silence" (m42 wave (a), TECH_DEBT
// item 3's sweep). Every former silent catch in src/ now reports here: one coded
// JSONL event into the mesh-log sink family (degrade.log beside the daemons' own
// logs), throttled per code so a hot degrade loop is bounded, and NEVER throwing —
// a degrade reporter that could itself crash the daemon would be worse than the
// silence it replaces.
//
// This module and mesh-log.mjs are the ONLY sanctioned silent-catch homes left
// (the acd-no-new-silent-catch baseline): the sink's own faults have nowhere
// lower to report.
