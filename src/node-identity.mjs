// src/node-identity.mjs — deterministic node-id derivation + capability-descriptor
// assembly (milestone 22 / story 01 / ADR-003; PERSIST TARGET RE-POINTED milestone 33
// / story 00 / ADR-004, F-3203).
//
// A node advertises WHO it is and WHAT it can run as a DERIVED, REBUILDABLE record:
// a projection of the install's config + environment, regenerable at any time (the
// 10/13 rebuildable-index discipline). This module owns two pure-ish mechanics:
//
//   deriveNodeId    — the documented-default id derivation (ADR-003): an operator /
//                     previously-persisted mesh.nodeId wins verbatim; else the
//                     sanitized hostname; an empty sanitized stem falls back to a
//                     deterministic node-<install-hash>; a collision against another
//                     install's id appends a stable per-install hash suffix. The
//                     resolved id is PERSISTED — as of ADR-004, to the git-ignored
//                     PER-INSTALL SIDECAR `.aof/mesh/identity.json`, NEVER the
//                     committed config — on first derivation, so it is stable across
//                     publishes (a hostname rename never churns the id) and
//                     operator-overridable (a sidecar-pinned id, set directly, wins
//                     verbatim and is never auto-healed — node-identity.mjs:74-78).
//
//   assembleDescriptor — assembles the frozen SIX-key capability descriptor. It READS
//                     config + environment and NEVER writes (only deriveNodeId's
//                     first-publish persist writes). Empty runtimes assemble as []
//                     (an honest minimal install), never absent / a crash.
//                     `skills` LEFT the descriptor in m34/story 02 by operator directive
//                     (see assembleDescriptor's own header for the reason); this summary
//                     still advertised seven keys and an empty `skills` array until 59/01
//                     re-armed the suite that would have contradicted it.
//
// White-box / INJECTABLE: hostname + salt are passed in so the sanitization matrix +
// the collision-suffix scenarios are testable without touching the real machine (the
// Build-notes injectability requirement). The id stays deterministic and [a-z0-9-]-only.
//
// Persisting the sidecar routes through the ONE sidecar read-merge-write
// (writeSidecarPatch, below — 22/R2: one writer per config subtree), re-pointed from
// the committed config and widened to the { nodeId, salt, derivedFrom, pinned }
// schema (the task-03 self-heal discriminator): readSidecar → shallow-merge a patch →
// writeText (2-space + trailing \n), idempotent (a no-op patch never rewrites). Every
// sidecar writer (persistNodeId, migrateIdentity, commands/mesh-identity.mjs's
// resolveInstallSalt) shares this ONE function. The committed config is never touched
// by the sidecar persist (ADR-004.2/.3) — a fresh derive leaves it byte-unchanged.
