description: The retrospective session — triage a milestone's mistakes/blockers (from STATE feedback notes + VERIFICATION findings) and distil them into RETROSPECTIVE.md as carryable lessons. Called at the close by aof:verify, or run directly to backfill past milestones.
aof-invocation: /aof:retrospective

<objective>
Produce (or refresh) a milestone's `RETROSPECTIVE.md` — the distilled lessons from how execution
actually went. The same session the close runs, made standalone so you can **backfill** milestones
accepted before they had a retro.
</objective>

<config>
Parse "$ARGUMENTS":
- a **ref** (`NN`, or a story's `NN/SS`) or **range** (`NN-MM`) → resolve via `aof work find <ref> --json` / iterate the range;
- **omitted** → every milestone that is `done` and has **no** `RETROSPECTIVE.md` yet (backfill mode).

**A STORY REF IS A FIRST-CLASS TARGET, AND ITS RETRO LANDS IN ITS OWN FOLDER (story 85).** Nesting is
not a reason to skip it: `NN/SS` writes `stories/<SS>_story_<slug>/RETROSPECTIVE.md`, a parentless
`NN` writes the story's own folder, and neither is satisfied by the milestone's. They answer
different questions — the milestone's retro carries what running the milestone taught, the story's
what building that story taught — and a reader of one story finds nothing of it in the document
above. Measured before story 85: 57 `RETROSPECTIVE.md` at driver level and **zero** under
`stories/`.
</config>

<process>
For each target item (a milestone NN, or a story — the steps are the same, read against that item's
own folder; a story has no `STATE.md`/`VERIFICATION.md` of its own, so its evidence is its review
findings, its `## Findings` section and any recorded blocker stop):

1. **Refresh observability (on by default).** Run `aof work observe NN --write --if-enabled` — the
   CLI self-gates on `work.observability.enabled`, which now defaults **ON** (set it to `false` to opt
   out), so it is always safe to call
   unconditionally (the CLI decides, not you). When enabled it (re)writes
   `NN/observability/{report.md,agents.json}` — the per-agent time / token / **stall** record mined
   from the session transcripts. It re-reads every transcript and overwrites, so a partial run is
   never wrong, only less complete; the close's run (all stories done) is the authoritative snapshot.
2. **Gather the evidence** (read-only):
   - `STATE.md` → the `## Feedback (for retro)` running notes (if any), durable decisions, the closure
     record, carried follow-ups — anything recording a mistake / blocker / decision-with-hindsight.
   - `VERIFICATION.md` → the **Findings** (defects/gaps caught at review) + their triage — the richest
     source for an already-accepted milestone.
   - `observability/agents.json` (if present) → per-agent spend + `stalls`. A **stall** (an agent idle
     past the threshold — dropped connection / interrupt / machine-off) or a grossly outsized
     time/token consumer is a candidate **process lesson** (Kind: blocker | near-miss · Area: process),
     never a product finding.
   - Any recorded blocker stops.
3. **Triage.** Keep only what carries a **lesson** — a mistake, blocker, near-miss, or misunderstanding
   worth not repeating. A finding that was a clean catch with no process lesson is **not** a retro
   entry (it already lives in VERIFICATION). Dedup against any existing `R<n>` entries.
4. **Distil + write** `RETROSPECTIVE.md` (`doc: retrospective`). One `R<n>` per lesson — **append**,
   never renumber:
   - **Kind:** mistake | blocker | near-miss | misunderstanding · **Area:** code | architecture | contract | security | process
   - **Stage:** refine | build | verify · **Owner:** the role/lane · **Raised by:** who flagged it
   - **What happened** *(factual)* · **Why** *(root cause)* · **Lesson** *(what to do differently)* · **Refs:** the VERIFICATION `@finding-<id>` / ADR / commit / `observability/report.md` — **reference, never restate**
5. **Conditional.** If a milestone surfaced nothing worth a lesson, **write no doc** and say so
   (absence is information). Never manufacture entries to fill the page. The `observability/` folder
   (when the opt-in is on) is written regardless — it is a diagnostic, not a lesson doc.
</process>

<output>
Per item: created / updated / skipped-clean, with the `R<n>` count and a one-line digest of each
lesson; note whether an `observability/` snapshot was written (or skipped: `work.observability.enabled: false`). Modify only
`RETROSPECTIVE.md` (the `observability/` folder is written by `aof work observe`, not by hand).
</output>
