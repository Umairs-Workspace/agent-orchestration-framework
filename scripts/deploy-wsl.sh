# scripts/deploy-wsl.sh — push this working tree into the WSL worker node's own clone.
#
# Invoked by `node scripts/install-local.mjs --wsl` (which computes the /mnt/… path and
# picks the distro); runnable by hand for a fast src-only iteration:
#
#   wsl -d Ubuntu-22.04 -- bash /mnt/c/Source/umami/aof/scripts/deploy-wsl.sh \
#       /mnt/c/Source/umami/aof ~/source/aof .aof-wsl-deploy
#
# WHY THE DISTRO NEEDS A SEPARATE TREE AT ALL (it is not duplication for its own sake):
#   - node-pty ships prebuilds for darwin-{arm64,x64} and win32-{arm64,x64} ONLY. There
#     is no linux-x64 prebuild, so the distro must COMPILE it against its own Node —
#     the Windows repo's node_modules holds a win32 binary the distro cannot load.
#   - Node resolves symlinks BEFORE resolving node_modules, so symlinking the distro's
#     src/ at the Windows src/ would make `import "ws"` resolve from the WINDOWS tree's
#     node_modules and fail. Copying is what keeps resolution on the native tree.
#
# It carries UNCOMMITTED work, which is the whole point of a local test node and the one
# thing the Mac worker's `git pull` flow cannot do.
#
# $1 = this repo, as a distro-visible path (/mnt/c/…)   $2 = distro-side repo dir
# $3 = the deploy-stamp filename (holds the sha256 of the lockfile last installed from)
