// Fitness function: acd-gate-propagation-never-discards (milestone 43 / ADR-008) —
//
//   "Gate propagation advances the item branch by fast-forward when possible and a real
//    MERGE otherwise — NEVER a rebase, a force-update or a reset. No worker commit is
//    ever discarded. A conflicting merge is aborted and refused, never left half-applied."
//
// WHY an ABSENCE is the right shape of guard. The gap is exact and is stated in the source
// itself (mesh-worker-execution.mjs:2369-2375): "The reuse doors ignore it by design: an
// existing line continues from where it is." Closing it means running a git operation
// against a branch that already carries the worker's commits — and every CONVENIENT way to
// do that destroys them: `rebase` rewrites the worker's history, `push --force` /
// `reset --hard` / `checkout -B` / `branch -f` / `update-ref` discard it outright. No
// scenario can prove an absence; a source guard can.
//
// The baseline is clean at HEAD and worth locking before the story lands: the only force
// in the path is `git worktree remove --force` (removing a WORKTREE, not a branch —
// sanctioned, and excluded from the detector by name), the only reset is a path-scoped
// `git reset -q -- .aof`, and the only push is a plain `git push origin <branch>`
// (mesh-worker-execution.mjs:583).
//
// Proofs:
//  1. GREEN — no history-rewriting or force git operation exists in the branch-advance
//     path (mesh-worktree.mjs, mesh-worker-execution.mjs, mesh-recovery-push.mjs).
//  2. ARMED — once a `merge` verb appears in mesh-worktree.mjs (the module that owns every
//     git verb, ADR-008's required home), an abort path must exist beside it: a conflicting
//     merge is `--abort`ed, never left for an agent to start a phase on.
//  Self-check (m03 non-vacuous): each forbidden form trips the detector, and the two
//  sanctioned forms (worktree remove --force, a path-scoped reset) do not.
