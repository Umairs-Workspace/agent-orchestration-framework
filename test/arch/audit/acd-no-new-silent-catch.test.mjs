// Fitness function: acd-no-new-silent-catch (milestone 42 wave (a), TECH_DEBT item 3
// — "silent catch {} is load-bearing").
//
// "Best-effort must mean 'does not crash', never 'says nothing'." Two silent-catch
// sites were written THE SAME DAY the first two were fixed — the class recurs faster
// than it is paid down, so this gate is a RATCHET: the current sites are enumerated
// as a per-file baseline that may only SHRINK. A NEW silent catch — in a baseline
// file beyond its count, or in any file not listed — fails the build immediately.
// The sweep (emitting coded events into mesh-log.mjs's sink instead) shrinks the
// baseline entry-by-entry until it is empty and the gate becomes an outright ban.
//
// DETECTED (comments stripped first, so a comment-only body counts — a comment is
// documentation, not a runtime signal):
//   - `catch {…}` / `catch (e) {…}` with a statement-empty body
//   - promise-form `.catch(() => {})` with an empty block body
// NOT detected (handled degrades, not silence): `.catch(() => null)` and any catch
// body with at least one statement — those return a value the caller branches on.

  // and by a second fitness function: it may import nothing from `src/` (so it cannot
  // reach `reportDegrade` — `acd-artifact-sync-hook-derivation-free` fails the build if
  // it tries), it must write nothing on stdout, and it must exit 0 because `PostToolUse`
  // cannot block. The ONE site is the queue append; its compensating control is the
  // daemon's reconciliation tick, which converges the artifact anyway. Pinned at 1 and
  // shrink-only, like every other entry — if the hook ever gains a second catch, this
  // gate reds.

  // is the PostToolUse liveness hook: every reporting channel is closed to it BY CONTRACT
  // and, as with its sibling, by a fitness function — `acd-heartbeat-by-consumption`
  // asserts `doesNotMatch(hook, /from ["'][^"']*src\//)`, so it cannot reach `reportDegrade`
  // without failing the build; it writes nothing on stdout; and it must exit 0 because
  // PostToolUse cannot block a completed tool call. Its ONE site is the heartbeat append,
  // and the compensating control is the consumer's own reclaim tick, which reads liveness
  // from the run record and does not depend on any single append landing.
  //
  // It was NOT in this list before, and that is the finding rather than the entry: it was
  // reported as a NEW silent catch for as long as the hook has existed, so this gate has
  // been red — on a site that meets its own stated exception — and the redness was read as
  // background. Pinned at 1 and shrink-only like every other entry: a second catch in that
  // hook reds this gate.
