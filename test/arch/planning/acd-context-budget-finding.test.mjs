// no error tier), path PRESENT and ABSOLUTE (path.isAbsolute, on-disk OS form — NOT
// cwd-/projectRoot-relativised), anchored at the over-budget FILE (ends with the
// SPEC.md / ARCHITECTURE.md / STORY.md that is too long), message present and naming
// the artifact + measured lines + budget.
//
// Proof: call doctorWork(workDir, config, undefined, { groups:[budgetGroup] }) over a
// fixture stream carrying an OVER-budget SPEC + ARCHITECTURE + STORY → assert every
