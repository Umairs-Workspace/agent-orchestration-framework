// Fitness function for milestone 02 / ADR-008 — the STANDING clone-smoke guard.
//
// The string-only blind spot that let F1 then F2 reach the verify gate:
// `acd-planning-install-commands` asserts the marketplace-add command *string*, not
// that the emitted `#<ref>` would actually CLONE. `claude plugin marketplace add
// <url>#<ref>` runs `git clone --branch <ref>`, which resolves only a real branch or
// tag name upstream. A pinned ref that looks right as a string but is not a clonable
// branch/tag (F1: SSH shorthand; F2: a bare 40-hex commit sha) passes the string
// test and STILL fails the live install. This test closes that gap: it builds the
// real plan, extracts the `#<ref>` the marketplace-add command actually emits, and
// proves that ref resolves to a real branch/tag upstream via
// `git ls-remote --exit-code`.
//
// Tri-state on the ls-remote exit code (NEVER silently pass, NEVER fail on infra):
//   0            → PASS  (the emitted ref resolves to a real clonable branch/tag)
//   2            → FAIL  (`--exit-code` + no matching ref: the emitted ref is NOT a
//                         clonable branch/tag upstream — F1/F2 regression)
//   any other    → LOUD SKIP (network/infra error — e.g. offline, DNS, git missing):
//                  print `# SMOKE SKIPPED (offline)…` and return without throwing.
//
// This is a NETWORKED test. It is imported into both runners (scripts/test.mjs and
// scripts/test-unit.mjs) and loud-skips when the network is unreachable, so a green
// run offline is honest (skip), not a false pass.
