// "aof never references headroom as a dependency or installs it — headroom is a
//  PATH-detected external tool. It appears nowhere in package.json deps/devDeps nor
//  as a package node in package-lock.json, and the plugin source never imports a
//  headroom package nor invokes an installer (npm/pip/cargo install …)."
//
// State now: the MANIFEST asserts (package.json / package-lock.json) are GREEN
// immediately — headroom is not, and must never become, a dependency. The SOURCE-
// import assert is CONDITIONAL: it is skipped until src/headroom.mjs exists, then
// enforced. That keeps this test honest at every stage (no false red for a file
// that isn't built yet, no false green once it is) — the no-install guarantee is
// purely structural, so this is arch-tests only, NOT a build story (mirrors the
// milestone 05 derived-index invariant being arch-tests only).
