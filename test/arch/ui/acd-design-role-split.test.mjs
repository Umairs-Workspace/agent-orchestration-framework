// Fitness function for milestone 07 / ADR-001 (the responsibility-split contract):
// "The design-conformance loop is split across exactly THREE parties by a STRUCTURAL tool
//  boundary: the bundled DESIGNER agent carries NO Bash (tools stay Read/Grep/Glob/Write/
//  WebSearch/WebFetch) and judges a PROVIDED screenshot — it never runs a browser; QA carries
//  Bash and owns running the Playwright harness + the toHaveScreenshot regression that locks
//  the designer-approved baseline; the ORCHESTRATION (verify/continue) renders and hands the
//  screenshot to the designer + spawns QA. No browser-run / toHaveScreenshot ownership appears
//  in the designer's contract."
//
// Reads the BUNDLED assets under src/bundle/ (ADR-005), NOT .claude/. Authored across the three
// stories' slices (story 00 designer, story 01 QA, story 02 orchestration) but kept in one file —
// it is one invariant (the split) read from the three assets that carry it.
//
// The designer FORBIDDING slice is a clean pattern-ABSENCE (the sound direction of a forbidding
// grep, per acd-capability-delegation's note): the two UNIQUE browser-execution ownership tokens
// — `npx playwright` and `toHaveScreenshot` — must not appear in the designer body at all. (Bare
// "Playwright" / "the browser" are NOT forbidden — the designer legitimately disclaims running
// them — so only the unique ownership tokens are asserted absent.)
