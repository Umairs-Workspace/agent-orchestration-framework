//
// "The fleet assign route targets the ITEM's own workspace, never the daemon's.
//  `workspaceId` is REQUIRED on the wire (blank => coded invalid-workspace, never
//  a fallback); it resolves to a projectRoot through the sanctioned
//  queryGlobalMeshStatus -> status.workspaces[] seam; a project root absent on
//  this machine is a loud workspace-not-local refusal; and BEFORE the mint the
//  route asserts the loaded workspace's OWN derived id equals the requested one,
//  refusing workspace-id-mismatch otherwise — so minting against a workspace
//  other than the one the operator clicked is structurally impossible."
//
// A COMPANION to acd-fleet-face-single-mutation-route (ADR-012 inv.1-4), which is
// left byte-untouched and green: this file arms ONLY the two NEW invariants, so
// the red it carries names exactly one thing.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. Measured live at the 2026-07-24 two-machine soak: the operator
// clicked "Homedata Live Property Data" (ref 18, lark-guard-portal, workspace
// 1f164bd03ea535da); the route returned 200 ok and minted ref 18 in the CONTROL's
// OWN aof workspace (9db1fd84f5895e38) — a different milestone entirely. Story
// 04's tasks 00-03 never caught it because they drive the route against the
// server's OWN workspace, the only workspace a single-workspace fixture has: a
// seam exercised only in the configuration where it cannot fail. Hence the
// behavioural half below stands up TWO published workspaces.
//
// STRUCTURAL half: source-analysis over the REAL src/mesh/ui-serve.mjs (comments
// discounted, CRLF-normalised — the tree is CRLF; an "\n"-only needle would
// silently no-op and leave the self-check vacuous). The detector extracts the
// POST /api/mesh/assign BRANCH BODY by brace-balancing and ASSERTS THE
// EXTRACTION LANDED (substantial + contains `assignWork(`) before probing it —
// the STATE.md lesson that a source-scanning detector which grabs a param-list
// `options = {}` self-passes vacuously. Every plant is a HAND-WRITTEN synthesized
// snippet (never a string-replace on the real file) and asserts it LANDED
// (`notEqual(planted, clean)`) before asserting the trip.
//
// BEHAVIOURAL half: the REAL serveMeshUi over an isolated AOF_GLOBAL_HOME v3
// store with TWO published workspaces, BOTH carrying an item at the SAME ref
// "18" and BOTH with an eligible target node — so a mis-target returns a
// plausible 200 and mints, exactly as it did live.
