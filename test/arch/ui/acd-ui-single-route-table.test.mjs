// Fitness function: acd-ui-single-route-table (m45 / ADR-001 + ADR-002) —
//
//   "There is ONE route table. The render root selects a surface by asking it, and by
//    no other means; and the application ENTRY imports surfaces, it does not define one."
//
// EXPECTED RED until milestone 45's stories land. This is the house convention: an arch
// test written at refine time is part of the CONTRACT, not a report on the present. It
// fails today for exactly three reasons, all of them the point of the milestone:
//   1. `ui/src/app/routes.mjs` does not exist;
//   2. `ui/src/main.tsx:1261-1266` selects the surface with its own query-param ternary
//      (`?mode` ?? import.meta.env.VITE_AOF_UI_MODE`), and `ui/src/vite-env.d.ts:4`
//      declares the env half of it;
//   3. `ui/src/main.tsx` is 1,267 lines because it IS the config editor — the entry file
//      defines the surface it is supposed to route to (ARCHITECTURE §Codebase health, 1).
//
// WHY A TABLE AND NOT A TERNARY. Today's selector is a single expression in one file, so
// "one home" is true by accident of there being only one place to put it. The moment a
// shell exists, a second selector is free to appear — a surface deciding for itself
// whether it is embedded, a nav element re-deriving the current page, an origin check.
// Each would look local and reasonable. Four milestones (46, 47, 49, 50) add or move a
// surface on top of this, so the rule has to be structural before they arrive rather
// than after.
//
// THE DETECTOR IS DELIBERATELY NARROW. `mode` is an ordinary word — `ui/src/board/runs.mjs:116`
// carries `{ command, ref, mode: "fresh" }`, which has nothing to do with routing. So the
// three LEGACY SELECTOR forms are matched exactly, and nothing else:
//   (a) a `?mode=<surface>` URL literal,  (b) a `.get("mode")` query read,
//   (c) the `VITE_AOF_UI_MODE` build-time env selector.
// Those three forms cover every real occurrence in `ui/src` today (5 of them) and match
// none of the innocent ones.
