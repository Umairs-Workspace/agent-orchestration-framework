// Fitness function: acd-spa-fallback-never-masks (m45 / ADR-004) —
//
//   "ONE shared module holds ALL THREE static-serving rules for BOTH servers: the history
//    fallback never shadows /api/* and never masks a missing asset, the traversal guard
//    and the MIME table each have exactly one definition, and the guard is decided BEFORE
//    the fallback so a refused path can never be answered with the app shell."
//
// EXPECTED RED until milestone 45's stories land: `src/static-serve.mjs` does not exist,
// neither server imports it, `safeStaticPath` and `contentType` are each defined twice, and
// `GET /fleet` on a setup/board origin 404s today.
//
// FOUR FINDINGS, NOT ONE — measured at source 2026-08-06 (`eacbd57`); (b) and (d) were added
// by the Three Amigos pass (Amigos-4 and Amigos-2 in ARCHITECTURE.md):
//
//   (a) `src/setup-ui.mjs` has NO fallback at all. `safeStaticPath` (:269) is a literal
//       file lookup and the handler (:130-140) is readFile().catch(404). That one handler
//       backs BOTH the board origin and the config origin, because `src/board-serve.mjs:20`
//       imports `serveSetupUi` and `serveBoard` (:60) points it at ui/dist. (Established by
//       GREP: the codebase graph's TSX/entry coverage did not reach setup-ui.mjs, so its
//       coupling is UNKNOWN to the graph — recording it as "no coupling" is exactly the
//       mistake the grounding step exists to prevent, so it was read at source instead.)
//
//   (b) `safeStaticPath` — the DIRECTORY-TRAVERSAL guard in front of both static roots (a
//       path.isAbsolute refusal plus a resolved-prefix containment check) — is defined TWICE
//       and the copies are BYTE-IDENTICAL: setup-ui.mjs:269-280 and mesh-ui-serve.mjs:873-884
//       (verified by `diff`, exit 0). Two copies of a traversal guard is the artefact that
//       gets hardened in one place and not the other, and nothing would say so. It sits on
//       the exact lines ADR-004 already edits, which is why de-duplicating it is in scope
//       rather than scope creep (ARCHITECTURE §Codebase health, finding 3).
//
//   (b2) `contentType` is a SECOND duplicated helper on the SAME lines — and unlike (b) the
//       copies have ALREADY DRIFTED: setup-ui.mjs:262-267 vs mesh-ui-serve.mjs:861-868
//       (`diff` exit 1). The fleet copy knows `.json` -> application/json and `.svg` ->
//       image/svg+xml; the board/config copy answers application/octet-stream for both.
//       Latent only because the built bundle is currently index.html plus hashed .js/.css;
//       live the first `.svg` vite emits, presenting as "the icon renders on the fleet and
//       downloads on the board". This is empirical proof of ADR-004's thesis: the pair was
//       duplicated at the same moment and one has already diverged while the other has not
//       YET. The merged table is the UNION (the fleet's richer one) — the intersection would
//       silently regress the origin that is currently correct.
//
//   (c) `src/mesh/ui-serve.mjs:558-568` falls back UNCONDITIONALLY. SPEC asks that the fleet
//       server's fallback be pinned by a test rather than assumed — but pinning it AS IS
//       would ratify a defect: a missing `/assets/index-abc.js` is answered with index.html
//       and `Content-Type: text/html`, so a broken deploy surfaces in the browser console as
//       `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'`, arbitrarily far from its cause. That is
//       precisely the failure the fallback rule exists to prevent — it simply already exists
//       on the origin nobody was worried about. ADR-004 therefore TIGHTENS the fleet server
//       with the same predicate rather than pinning it.
//
//   (d) THE ORDER OF (a) AND (b) IS UNSTATED, AND IT IS SECURITY-ADJACENT. Both servers
//       happen to return at the traversal guard today (setup-ui.mjs:131-134,
//       mesh-ui-serve.mjs:554-557), but nothing said they must — and adding a fallback is
//       exactly the change that makes wiring it in the wrong place attractive
//       (`if (!filePath) -> fall back` is the tidy-looking refactor). Measured 2026-08-06:
//       four traversal encodings survive WHATWG URL parsing INTACT and end in a segment with
//       no `.` in it, so `safeStaticPath` returns null AND `shouldServeAppShell` independently
//       returns true for each. A handler that treats "guard refused" as "file missing"
//       answers 200 text/html to an attempted directory escape. It leaks no file, but it
//       converts a refusal into a success — the opposite of this repo's "a refusal must name
//       its own cause" rule — and it does so silently.
//
// WHY A SHARED MODULE AND NOT TWO CONDITIONS. A rule copied into two servers is a rule that
// is true in one of them — (b2) is the PROOF, not the theory: same duplication moment, and
// one of the pair has already diverged. `src/static-serve.mjs` is a pure leaf holding all
// three rules; both servers import all three and re-derive none. It is named for what it
// holds: calling it `spa-fallback.mjs` and then putting a traversal guard and a MIME table in
// it would be the same under-description one layer up.
//
// WHY THE DISCRIMINATOR IS "NO FILE EXTENSION" (ADR-004 records the two rejections):
//   - `Accept: text/html` was REJECTED — it makes one URL answer differently depending on a
//     request header, so curl, this repo's headless harnesses and a browser get different
//     bodies for the same address.
//   - A route-derived allowlist was REJECTED — the server would have to learn the client's
//     route table, which means either `src/` imports `ui/src/` (a new and wrong coupling
//     direction) or the list is duplicated (two homes for one fact). It would also split the
//     not-found experience in two: a deep-linked typo would get a plain-text server 404 while
//     the same typo reached by in-app navigation gets the shell's 404 surface (ADR-002).
