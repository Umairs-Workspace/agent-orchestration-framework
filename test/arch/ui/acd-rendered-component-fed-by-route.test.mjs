// Fitness function: acd-rendered-component-fed-by-route (milestone 38 / ADR-008)
//
// THE INVARIANT (ADR-008, the mounted-component half). A component must be tested
// through the component PRODUCTION ACTUALLY RENDERS for the payload its route
// returns — never a convenient stand-in. Concretely, for the fleet page: EVERY
// component that renders a per-node card from a `/api/mesh/status` payload must derive
// its current-work line from the ONE shared projection (`fleetCurrentWorkLines` /
// its `nodeCurrentWork` wrapper). No branch of the page may render a node card with no
// current-work line — and no branch may fork its own collapse rule.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS — finding F9 (aof:verify 38, BLOCKER). `ui/src/fleet/Fleet.tsx`
// branches `isGlobalStatus(status) ? <GlobalScopeView/> : <NodesRegion/>`. Milestone
// 38's session render went into `NodesRegion → NodeCard`. But `src/mesh/ui-serve.mjs`
// serves BOTH scopes from `queryGlobalMeshStatus` (its ONE data source), whose payload
// ALWAYS carries `workspaces` — so `isGlobalStatus` is ALWAYS true and the app ALWAYS
// mounts `GlobalScopeView → GlobalNodePanel`, which had NO current-work line at all.
// `NodeCard` was DEAD CODE in production, and its fixture-fed green test hid the bug
// for the whole milestone. A suite can be entirely green about a component the user
// never sees.
//
// PROOFS:
//  1. PRODUCER-FED (behavioural) — the REAL route data source (`queryGlobalMeshStatus`,
//     the only module `mesh-ui-serve.mjs` imports for `/api/mesh/status`) returns, for
//     BOTH scopes, a payload carrying the `workspaces` array Fleet.tsx narrows on. The
//     mounted branch is therefore the GLOBAL one — established from the producer, not
//     assumed.
//  2. STRUCTURAL — in Fleet.tsx, every component that maps over `nodes` (i.e. renders
//     a per-node card) derives its current-work line from the shared projection, either
//     itself or in the card component it renders. Pre-F9 `GlobalNodePanel` fails this.
//  3. STRUCTURAL — the route keeps ONE data source (no second status query slipping in
//     behind the page's narrowing), so the payload shape the components are held to is
//     the only one production can serve.
//  4. SELF-CHECK (non-vacuous) — the analyzer, run over a PLANTED Fleet source that is
//     the real one with the F9 defect re-introduced (the global panel's projection call
//     removed), reports exactly `GlobalNodePanel`; run over the real source it reports
//     nothing.
