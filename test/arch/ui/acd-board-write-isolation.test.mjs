//
// The board surface performs exactly one CAPTURE mutation — append immutable raw
// evidence, then project an attributed bullet under `## Feedback (for retro)` in
// the selected milestone/story STATE.md. It never writes item status/frontmatter,
// exposes no restatus route, and runs in-process (no CLI shell-out).
//
// Milestone 08 (ADR-002/003) re-homed that sole write OUT of `board-ui.mjs` and
// INTO the `work:feedback` command (`src/commands/feedback.mjs`): `board-ui.mjs`
// is now a thin face that `invoke`s the command through the registry and itself
// performs NO fs write. The write-isolation GUARANTEE is unchanged — it has only
// moved with the code — so this fitness function now anchors the "sole writer"
// lens at the command's new home while still proving `board-ui.mjs` writes nothing
// and shells out to nothing, plus the unchanged behavioural end-to-end (posting
// feedback over the migrated seam changes only its append-only raw ledger and STATE.md projection).
