//    away — and every producer emits a PATH."
//
// EXPECTED RED until milestone 45's stories land. Seven violations exist today, and they
// are the milestone's edit list (measured 2026-08-06 at `eacbd57`):
//   src/board-serve.mjs:41,62                          `?mode=board`
//   src/mesh/ui-serve.mjs:143,736                       `?mode=fleet[&scope=…]`
//   src/commands/assets-ui.mjs:45,117                   `?mode=assets`
//   app/desktop/crates/app/src/supervisor.rs:44         `?mode=fleet&scope=global`  (COMPILED)
//   ui/src/board/Board.tsx:416                          `http://127.0.0.1:4181/?mode=fleet`
//   ui/src/board/DetailPanel.tsx:270                    `…/?mode=fleet&scope=global`
//   ui/src/fleet/Fleet.tsx:1398                         `/?mode=board`
//
// WHY THIS IS A STRUCTURAL RULE AND NOT A TIDY-UP. ADR-003's back-compat guarantee rests
// on a measurement: *every* URL this system has ever advertised carries `?mode=`, and
// nothing advertises a bare `/`. That is what makes the legacy translation total. The
// guarantee decays the instant a NEW producer emits the legacy form — the translation
// then has to keep working forever for URLs this codebase is still minting, and the
// address bar goes back to meaning two things at once. So the rule is not "clean these
// up"; it is "the legacy vocabulary is read-only, and only the translator may read it".
//
// SCOPE: production code only — `src/`, `ui/src/`, `app/desktop/`. The behavioural suites
// that assert an advertised URL *contains* `mode=` (test/mesh/ui/mesh-ui-serve.test.mjs:126,303,
// test/ui/board-serve.test.mjs:186, test/ui/work-ui-verb-rename.test.mjs:187,
// test/mesh/ui/mesh-ui-cli-face.test.mjs:205, test/mesh/ui/mesh-ui-global-scope.test.mjs:219) change in the
// same story that changes the producers; they are the milestone's OWN proof, and having
// this gate also police them would report one change twice.
//
// COMMENTS ARE HISTORY, NOT CODE. `src/mesh/ui-serve.mjs:5,111`, `src/board-serve.mjs:61`,
// `src/board-mesh-execution.mjs:4`, `src/commands/mesh-ui.mjs:6,25` and `supervisor.rs:37-44`
// all narrate the legacy form in prose. This repo's comments carry real load (TECH_DEBT
// item 0.4 warns against the opposite failure), so they are stripped before matching — and
// the stripper is URL-aware, because the violations live INSIDE `http://…` literals.
//
// ── THE CLOSING ASSERTION (added 2026-08-07, at the architect's structural review of 45/04).
// This file shipped with TWO checks and a NAME that promised a third. The second assertion
// was called "the enumeration is checkable, so a fifth producer cannot appear unseen" — but
// its body iterates `PRODUCERS`, a hand-maintained four-entry list, so it can only ever say
// something about those four files. MEASURED, in a sandbox copy of the 45/04 tree: dropping a
// new `src/` module that returns `` `http://127.0.0.1:${port}/fleet?repo=demo` `` left all
// three assertions GREEN, while the same module minting `?mode=fleet` was caught. The LEGACY
// half of the vocabulary was ratcheted; the PATH half was not, and the name said otherwise.
//
// So the two rules are now stated separately and each is named for what it does:
//   - the LEGACY ban (assertion 1) — an open sweep: nobody may mint `?mode=`.
//   - the four listed producers each name their path (assertion 2) — a CLOSED list, and its
//     name now says "these four" instead of claiming to see a fifth.
//   - the CLOSING rule (assertion 3, new) — the open sweep the name was promising: every file
//     in `src/` · `ui/src/` · `app/desktop/` that mints an ADR-002 ROUTE PATH must be one of
//     the eight files declared here. A fifth producer now fails CI naming its two remedies.
// This matters because milestones 47, 49 and 50 each plausibly add a URL producer, and
// ADR-002's "small, enumerable edit set — not a sweep" is exactly the property that decays
// the moment one appears that nobody enumerated.
//
// WHY A LITERAL SWEEP IS THE RIGHT DETECTOR HERE, and what it deliberately does NOT do. It
// cannot see a path composed at runtime from a variable — that half is behavioural and is
// owned by `test/ui/in-app-cross-links.test.mjs` (no RENDERED anchor names `mode`) and by
// `test/command/advertised-paths.test.mjs` (every launcher's real `--json` and announce channel).
// The two halves are complementary by construction: a hand-rolled copy fails the gate without
// failing those suites, and a runtime-composed selector fails those suites without failing the
// gate. Neither is a substitute for the other, and saying so here stops a later reader
// mistaking one green for both.
//
// `ui/src/app/shell-nav.mjs` is deliberately NOT on the allow-list, though it is the shell's
// navigation home: it derives every href from `ROUTES` (`ROUTES.filter(...)`, `route.path`) and
// names no literal at all. Allow-listing it would pre-authorise a hard-coded path in the one
// module whose whole design is not to have one.
