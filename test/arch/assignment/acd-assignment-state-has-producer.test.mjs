// Fitness function: acd-assignment-state-has-producer (milestone 35 / ADR-001 /
// R2·m20, fitness #2) — "Every value in the assignment state set maps to exactly ONE
// named producer in a single source-of-truth table/enum; no state exists without a
// writer."
//
// Proofs:
//  1. Load the single ASSIGNMENT_STATE_PRODUCERS enum (assignment-record.mjs). Assert
//     its keys equal EXACTLY {assigned, accepted, running, done, failed, withdrawn,
//     reclaimed}, and each maps to a non-empty producer id.
//  2. The union of producers the codebase actually WRITES (grep the dedicated writer
//     call sites for the state literals they set — insertAssignment/
//     updateAssignmentState call sites in mesh-assign.mjs) is a subset of the mapped
//     producers — no orphan state, no producerless state.
//  3. Self-check (m03 non-vacuous): a planted state with no producer entry fails the
//     SAME detector the real enum passes.
