// Fitness function: acd-assignment-worktree-path-scoped (milestone 35 / ADR-004,
// fitness #8) — "every worktree materialization joins the ONE defined mesh-worktrees
// root, keyed by assignmentId — no ad-hoc temp path."
//
// This is the ARCHITECTURE-named half of a single invariant shared with SECURITY's F4
// (acd-worktree-path-scoped, T4/T3b) — the second file (acd-worktree-path-scoped.
// test.mjs) enumerates/references THIS file's assertions rather than duplicating the
// assertion body (the repo's "enumerate the re-armed X" house style, e.g.
// acd-fleet-reclaim-guarded's re-arm of acd-run-reclaim-stale-only /
// acd-status-rollback-bounded).
//
// Proofs:
//  1. Structural — src/mesh/worktree.mjs's `git worktree add` target is built ONLY
//     from meshWorktreePath(projectRoot, assignmentId), which itself joins
//     meshWorktreesRoot (".aof/mesh/worktrees"); no os.tmpdir() join, no other
//     hand-built path feeds a `git worktree add` call.
//  2. Behavioural — for a valid ref, the resolved worktree path, normalised, is a
//     prefix-child of the dedicated root; a REAL `git worktree add` lands exactly
//     there.
//  Self-check (m03 non-vacuous): a planted `git worktree add` off an os.tmpdir() path
//  fails the SAME structural detector the real (scoped) source passes.
