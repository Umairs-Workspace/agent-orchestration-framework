// Security fitness function: acd-worktree-path-scoped (F4, T4/T3b) — "the
// materialised worktree path is under the dedicated mesh worktree root, and the
// assigned ref cannot escape it."
//
// F4 is TWO parts (SECURITY.md): (a) behavioural — a valid ref's resolved worktree
// path, normalised, is a prefix-child of the dedicated root; a traversal ref
// resolution yields no item, never an escape. (b) source-analysis — the worktree/ref-
// resolution module builds no `path.join(<root>, <directiveRef>)` from raw directive
// text.
//
// Part (a)'s "materialised worktree path is under the dedicated root" is the SAME
// invariant ARCHITECTURE's #8 (acd-assignment-worktree-path-scoped) already proves —
// this file does NOT duplicate that assertion body; it enumerates/references that
// sibling file's registration (the repo's "enumerate the re-armed X" house style,
// e.g. acd-fleet-reclaim-guarded's re-arm of acd-run-reclaim-stale-only) and adds the
// GENUINELY NEW half: the ref-resolution "never path.join(root, directiveRef)" source
// guard, plus the behavioural "a traversal ref yields no item, never escapes" proof
// (which #8 does not itself assert — #8 is scoped to the worktree ADD path, not ref
// resolution INSIDE the worktree).
//
// Self-check (m03 non-vacuous): a planted `path.join(worktreeRoot, directive.itemRef)`
// trips the detector; the real enumerate-then-filter form (resolveRefInWorktree ->
// findWork) does not.
