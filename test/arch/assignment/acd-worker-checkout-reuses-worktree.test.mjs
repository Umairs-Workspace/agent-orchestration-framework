// Fitness function: acd-worker-checkout-reuses-worktree (milestone 38 / ADR-006) —
// "the worker-repo-checkout story introduces NO second `git worktree add` call site
// outside the mesh-worktree.mjs addWorktree seam" — re-arming the m35 worktree-scope
// invariant (acd-assignment-worktree-path-scoped) against a regression from THIS
// milestone's clone-on-miss work.
//
// ARCHITECTURE 38/ADR-006: worker-worktrees has ZERO net-new work — clone-on-miss
// (ADR-005) is a PREFIX before the existing m35 addWorktree->run flow, never a second
// worktree implementation. The ONLY place `git worktree add` may ever be spawned is
// inside mesh-worktree.mjs's addWorktree(); mesh-worker-execution.mjs (this
// milestone's clone/register/fall-through module) may CALL that seam but must never
// spawn `worktree add` itself.
//
// Proofs:
//  1. Structural — src/mesh/worktree.mjs is the ONLY module containing a literal
//     `"worktree", "add"` (or `worktree add`) argv shape.
//  2. Structural — src/mesh/worker-execution.mjs calls addWorktree(...) (the existing
//     m35 seam) and contains NO second `"worktree"` / `"add"` argv pairing of its own.
//  3. Structural — the ARCHITECTURE #8 sibling (acd-assignment-worktree-path-scoped)
//     stays registered in the suite — this file re-arms it, never duplicates its body
//     (the repo's "enumerate the re-armed X" house style).
//  Self-check (m03 non-vacuous): a planted SECOND `git worktree add` call site inside
//  mesh-worker-execution.mjs trips the detector; the real (single-seam) source does not.
