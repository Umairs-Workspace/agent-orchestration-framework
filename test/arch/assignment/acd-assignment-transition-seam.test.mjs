// Fitness function: acd-assignment-transition-seam (milestone 42 wave (d) leg d3;
// PRD-command-spine-effects-ledger: "the apply-seam guards (holder,
// terminal-never-regresses) move inside the shared transition so ALL writers
// inherit them").
//
// THE INVARIANT — one transition seam in front of the assignment fact.
// `updateAssignmentState` is guard-free by design; its two invariants used to live
// at ONE of its three call sites (the control stream's apply handler), which is why
// the withdraw verb carried a weaker re-derivation and the reclaim tick carried
// none. This gate pins the cure structurally, the `completeRun` precedent in
// acd-effects-ledger:
//
//   (1) REACHABILITY — `updateAssignmentState` is called only from its own store
//       module and from effects/assignment-transitions.mjs. Any other writer would
//       be a door around the guards.
//   (2) THE GUARDS ARE THE SEAM'S — the apply handler no longer decides them: its
//       body contains no holder comparison against `target_node_id` and no
//       terminal-state branch; it calls the transition instead.
//   (3) THE RULES THEMSELVES still hold, proven by running the pure guard over the
//       matrix rather than by grepping for its text: unknown row, non-holder,
//       every terminal state, the ONE sanctioned resume revival, and the active
//       states that must pass.
//   (4) The settle raises its declared event — `assignment.settled` is in the
//       closed vocabulary with its `control-store` reactor, so the branch record
//       that used to be an inline line at the apply seam is now a ledger entry.
