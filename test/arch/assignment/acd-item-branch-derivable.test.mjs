// Fitness functions for the m42 brittleness cure (2026-07-31; STATE §Residual
// defects — "THE structural debt"): ONE DERIVABLE BRANCH PER ITEM.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES. Work lived on per-assignment branches
// (`aof/mesh/<ref>-<assignmentId>`) that ONLY the `global_item_branches` side
// table remembered — every consumer had to remember the lookup, and forgetting
// it was the measured wrong-base dispatch (2026-07-27: milestone 18's autonomous
// continue built from main with none of its refined stories). The cure: the
// branch is DERIVABLE from the ref alone (`meshItemBranchName` → `aof/mesh/<ref>`),
// so a forgetful consumer CONVERGES on the item's own line instead of forking;
// the side table survives as a CACHE that wins when present (continuity for
// pre-cure suffixed branches and reindexed items).
//
//   (1) THE PER-ASSIGNMENT MINT IS RETIRED (ratchet): `meshWorkerBranchName`
//       exists nowhere in src/ — its collision-freedom was the disease's carrier.
//   (2) ONE MINT, KNOWN CALLERS: `meshItemBranchName` is defined once and called
//       only by the worker's dispatch fallback and the recovery-push module.
//   (3) THE WORKER'S FALLBACK CONVERGES: the branch is `baseBranch ?? derivation`,
//       and an already-existing derived branch takes the REUSE door (source
//       order: the existence check precedes the worktree add).
//   (4) THE CACHE'S PLACE IS PINNED: the control dispatch tick is CACHE-ONLY
//       (deriving there would fail the reuse door for a never-pushed item — the
//       worker owns the fallback); the recovery-push tick is CACHE-FIRST (a
//       pre-cure stranded worktree sits on a name only the cache knows).
//   (5) THE DERIVATION IS PURE AND STABLE: same ref → same valid `aof/mesh/`
//       ref, no assignment id anywhere in it.
