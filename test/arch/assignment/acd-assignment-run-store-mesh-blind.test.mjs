// Fitness function: acd-assignment-run-store-mesh-blind (milestone 35 / ADR-004,
// fitness #12) — "the run-store stays mesh-blind — the assignment execution reuses
// startRun/completeRun/heartbeat with the node id passed as DATA; the store imports
// no mesh/assignment module." Re-arms the existing acd-run-store-mesh-free (m26) —
// this file does NOT duplicate its assertion body; it enumerates/references its
// registration (the repo's "enumerate the re-armed X" house style) and adds the ONE
// genuinely-new assertion this milestone introduces: the WORKER EXECUTION module
// (Story 02's new code) calls startRun(item, { node }) with the node id as an option,
// never rewriting run-store's signature or importing a mesh module INTO run-store.
//
// BUILD-TIME FINDING (flagged, not silently fixed — see STORE.md Feedback notes): the
// SIBLING m26 fitness `acd-fleet-reclaim-guarded` (which #12 was ALSO asked to
// re-arm) is imported into scripts/test.mjs but was NEVER spread into the assembled
// `tests` array — a genuine pre-existing registration gap spanning ~34 arch-test
// bindings across milestones 22-26 (verified by diffing every imported binding
// against every `...binding` spread in the array). Running it standalone shows 3 of
// its 4 proofs pass; the 4th ("the run-complete lease release sits inside the
// config.mesh-gated branch") is now STALE — `src/commands/run-complete.mjs` no
// longer imports `releaseLease`/`meshNodeIdOf` at all (the whole git-bus lease
// mechanism it asserts was retired by the m33/m34 "global mesh only" correction /
// ADR-003's no-git-bus-return). Registering that file as-is would land a KNOWN-RED,
// pre-existing, out-of-milestone test — outside this story's ownership to rewrite.
// This story registers ONLY the sibling that is genuinely green
// (acd-run-store-mesh-free) and leaves acd-fleet-reclaim-guarded's registration +
// stale 4th proof as a flagged finding for the architect/PO to triage.
//
// Proofs:
//  1. Re-arm — acd-run-store-mesh-free is registered in the suite (its own
//     assertions already prove run-store.mjs imports no mesh-* module).
//  2. Structural — src/mesh/worker-execution.mjs calls startRun(item, { ...,
//     node: nodeId, ... }) — the node id travels as a DATA option, never a run-store
//     rewrite (no new positional parameter, no mesh import added to run-store.mjs).
//  3. Behavioural — a driven assignment's minted run carries the worker's node id
//     while run-store.mjs itself imports no mesh module.
//  Self-check (m03 non-vacuous): a planted `import ... from "./mesh-store.mjs"` in
//  run-store.mjs fails the SAME detector the real (mesh-blind) source passes.
