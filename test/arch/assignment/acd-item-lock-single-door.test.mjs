// Fitness function: acd-item-lock-single-door (milestone 43 / ADR-003) —
//
//   "The item lock is scoped by ONE `executionScopeRef` rule, which lives in a pure
//    LEAF; the single enforcement door is inside `transitionRunStart`; no command
//    module re-derives an active-assignment query for lock purposes; and the run STORE
//    stays mesh-blind."
//
// WHY structural. STATE measured two holes at HEAD: (1) `findActiveAssignment`
// (assignment-record.mjs:203) matches item_ref EXACTLY while execution is
// milestone-scoped — the read side already owns the scope rule
// (board-mesh-execution.mjs:117-136, whose own comment says "This is the ONE home for
// the scope rule"), the write side does not use it; (2) nothing local honours the lock
// — run-start never queries global_assignments and `work next` hands out a held item.
// ADR-003 puts the guard INSIDE the mint seam (effects/run-transitions.mjs:39 — reached
// from exactly five call sites in three modules and from nowhere else), mirroring
// effects/assignment-transitions.mjs's discipline: "the rules live ONCE, in front of the
// write, and no writer can reach the fact without them." The PLACEMENT is the invariant;
// the refusal itself (`item-locked-by-assignment`) is behavioural and belongs in a
// scenario.
//
// The layering clause is load-bearing: `board-mesh-execution.mjs` is a FACE module
// (imported by continue/list/run-status, imports 6). The spine must not import it — which
// is why ADR-003 moves `executionScopeRef` DOWN into `assignment-record.mjs` (imported by
// 6, IMPORTS 0 — a pure leaf). This guard asserts the rule has ONE definition wherever it
// lives, so the move cannot leave a second copy behind.
//
// Proofs:
//  1. GREEN — `executionScopeRef` is DEFINED in exactly one module in src/ (today
//     board-mesh-execution.mjs; after the story, assignment-record.mjs). A second copy
//     is the "one fact, many derivations" disease (TECH_DEBT item 0).
//  2. GREEN — src/run-store.mjs imports no assignment/lock/mesh module: the lock must not
//     leak into the mesh-blind store (re-arms acd-run-store-mesh-free's subject from this
//     milestone's angle; its own assertions are not duplicated here).
//  3. ARMED — once the lock predicate module exists, `effects/run-transitions.mjs` imports
//     it (the mint door is guarded at the seam), and no command module calls
//     `findActiveAssignment` directly for the check (that would be the rule living at
//     whichever call site needed it first).
//  Self-check (m03 non-vacuous): planted second definitions and planted store/command
//  imports trip the SAME detectors.
