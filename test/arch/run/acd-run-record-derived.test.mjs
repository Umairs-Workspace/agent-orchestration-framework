// The derived-record invariant: the runs/ log is a DERIVED artifact, never an
// authoritative second copy of item state. Pruning OR rebuilding the runs/ log
// changes NO item's frontmatter status — item frontmatter stays the single source
// of truth.
//
// This test covers the FULL invariant — BOTH (a) prune (delete runs/) AND (b)
// rebuild (start runs again) — not just prune (the explicit m10/R3 lesson: when you
// add a derived artifact that mirrors an existing one, cover the full invariant, not
// just the new-and-obvious case). The record-doc bytes are captured via recordDoc(item)
// (AOF.md-first else SPEC.md — NOT a hard-coded SPEC.md), per the Build note.
