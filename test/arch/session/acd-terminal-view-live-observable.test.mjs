// Fitness function: acd-terminal-view-live-observable
// (milestone 38 / story 06; ARCHITECTURE ADR-013 invariant 7 + ADR-014 invariant 8;
//  DESIGN §Surface 3 V7/V9; SECURITY T14).
//
// "The fleet terminal-VIEW is observable ACROSS THE WHOLE LIFE OF A RUN: the
//  (nodeId, sessionId) join key reaches the control node WHILE the run is still
//  live (not only when it ends), and the stream's END is PRODUCED by the worker
//  (not inferred, not timed out, not read off the assignment's state)."
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS — the milestone's defining class, twice more.
//   clause (a) / ADR-013 inv.7 (raised at the task-04 structural review, 2026-07-23).
//     `capturedSessionId` is populated MID-RUN (mesh-worker-execution.mjs, the
//     transcript-watch resolution) and rides every terminal frame from that instant.
//     But the ONLY session-id-carrying assignment-status frames are the terminal ones
//     (`done`/`failed`) plus `needs-input`; the `running` frame that OPENS the run is
//     sent BEFORE the driver spawns and carries `{ runId }` only, and no further
//     status frame is sent for the rest of the run. So on an ordinary run
//     `global_assignments.session_id` stays NULL until the run is OVER — the card
//     resolves `no-session` and opens no socket for exactly the interval an operator
//     wants to watch.
//   clause (b) / ADR-014 inv.8 (BLOCKER F-38.06e, raised at QA, 2026-07-23).
//     The terminal-frame protocol has NO end-of-stream marker at all, and the fleet
//     route unsubscribes only on the BROWSER's own close. Nothing ever tells a
//     watching browser that the session ended, so `TERMINAL_VIEW_STATES.ENDED` is
//     unreachable from a real session end and an open view sits on
//     `streaming`/`live:true`/`motion:"pulse"` forever — V9's exact forbidden state.
//
// ARMED **RED-UNTIL-FIXED, BY DESIGN** (the F17 / acd-fleet-terminal-frame-connection-
// identity precedent this milestone already set: a fitness that pins an open finding
// RED is how a known-inert seam is stopped from reading green). The REAL-SOURCE lanes
// below FAIL on today's tree and go GREEN the moment the producers land — and RED
// again if either is ever reverted. The SYNTHESIZED self-check lanes pass REGARDLESS
// of tree state, proving the detectors are correct rather than merely red.
//
// Every plant is a HAND-WRITTEN synthesized snippet (never a string-replace on a real
// file, and never a write into one — the house convention), each asserting it LANDED
// before asserting the detector trips. Comments discounted, CRLF-normalised: the
// repo's tree is mixed CRLF/LF and an "\n"-only needle would silently no-op — the
// exact failure class this milestone was repeatedly burned by.
