// Fitness function: acd-session-presence-additive (milestone 38 / ADR-001) —
// "the live-session signal is an ADDITIVE key on the FROZEN m23 presence record; the
// m23 four keys keep their byte-order, and a record with no sessions is byte-stable."
//
// The m23 presence record is FROZEN at { nodeId, heartbeatAt, activeRuns, aofVersion }
// (23/ADR-002, mesh-presence-record.test.mjs — key order load-bearing, byte-equivalence
// on read-back). Milestone 38 evolves it ADDITIVELY: a `sessions` array is inserted
// before the trailing `aofVersion`, so the frozen four keep their RELATIVE order and a
// no-session record's first-four-keys projection stays byte-identical to an m23 record.
//
// STATE OF BUILD: the `sessions` key is not yet emitted by assemblePresenceRecord (the
// story builds it). Until then this fitness function pins the INVARIANT that survives
// the evolution: whatever assemblePresenceRecord returns, its FROZEN FOUR m23 keys
// appear in the m23 order as a contiguous, order-preserving subsequence — so an additive
// key can never reorder or drop them. This assertion is TRUE today (the four keys are the
// whole record) and STAYS true after the additive `sessions` key lands; it fails only if
// the m23 order is broken. The self-check plants exactly that break.
//
// Proofs:
//  1. The m23 four keys appear in EXACTLY the m23 relative order in the assembled record
//     (a subsequence check — additive keys allowed, reorder/drop forbidden).
//  2. The four-key PROJECTION (only the m23 keys) is byte-identical to a hand-built m23
//     record for the same inputs — the additive evolution never disturbs the frozen four.
//  Self-check (m03 non-vacuous): a reordered / dropped m23 key trips the SAME detector.
