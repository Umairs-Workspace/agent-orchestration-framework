// Fitness function for milestone 05 / ADR-001 + ADR-005 + ADR-007:
// "A fresh `reindex` from the .md files reproduces the index, and EVERY record's
//  `source` (path:line) resolves to live text at/after the recorded line in the
//  named file — memory holds no fact absent from its source."
//
// Behavioural proof (not a source grep): build the local index into a temp store
// from a small real/fixture stream; for each record split `source` into path:line,
// read that file, assert a line exists at/after the recorded line and the record's
// summary/title traces to text there; assert a SECOND reindex yields the identical
// record set (idempotent / no accretion).

- **Kind:** near-miss · **Area:** tooling · **Stage:** build · **Owner:** developer · **Raised by:** developer
- **What happened:** the index was built.
- **Why:** because it is derived.
- **Lesson:** keep the index rebuildable and source-traced.

## ADR-001: A tiny derived-index decision

**Decision.** the index is a derived store, never a second source of truth.

**Invariant.** every record's source resolves to live text.
