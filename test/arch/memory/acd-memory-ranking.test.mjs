// Fitness function for milestone 05 / ADR-006 (acd-memory-ranking):
//
//   "recall applies scope filters as a HARD pre-filter before scoring (no
//    off-scope record appears in results), and scoring is length-normalised so
//    raw term repetition in a longer record cannot outrank a shorter, denser
//    match of equivalent relevance — the spike's documented F1 inversion does
//    NOT recur."
//
// Behavioural proof over a HAND-AUTHORED fixture index (the frozen ADR-005
// MemoryRecord shape) — no indexer code (story 01), no seam/argv (story 00). The
// fixture mirrors the spike's scenario: one LONG, term-heavy `adr` that repeats
// the query terms many times, and one SHORT, on-point `lesson` of equivalent
// relevance, plus an OFF-SCOPE record that would out-score the survivors if scope
// were a soft signal rather than a hard pre-filter.
