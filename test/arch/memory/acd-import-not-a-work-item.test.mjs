// Fitness function for milestone 13 / ADR-004:
// "An import is never a managed work item. Nothing the import materializes is a
//  top-level NN_type_slug folder under workDir; the import store lives OUTSIDE workDir
//  (under .aof/) and is git-ignored via the NESTED .aof/imports/.gitignore baseline (NOT
//  the repo-root .gitignore), so the work-item resolver — listItems/findWork/nextWork/
//  validateWork (ALL via listItems(workDir)) — never enumerates an import as a
//  milestone/story/task/uat. An import is consequently never refine/continue/verify-able."
//
// Mirrors the codebase-graph-derived git-ignore idiom (git status / check-ignore over a
// real temp git repo), pinned to the NESTED store ignore (story 00's `*`+`!.gitignore`),
// NOT the repo root. Halves, all CI-able offline:
//   (a) RESOLVER-EXCLUSION: materialize a FIXTURE import into a temp project, then run
//       listItems(workDir) / findWork / nextWork / validateWork over the work stream and
//       assert NONE returns the import as a resolvable item (a real work-stream milestone
//       IS resolved, so the exclusion is a POSITIVE exclusion, not an empty stream).
//   (b) OUTSIDE-WORKDIR + NON-NN_TYPE_SLUG: importStoreRoot is OUTSIDE workDir; the
//       per-import folder name (import-<ref>) does NOT match ITEM_RE.
//   (c) GIT-IGNORED-NESTED: in a real temp git repo, `git status --porcelain` shows
//       NOTHING under the import store (the nested .aof/imports/.gitignore covers it), the
//       nested ignore file exists, and the repo-root .gitignore was NOT created/touched.
//
// Non-vacuous (the load-bearing trap): the fixture deliberately materializes under a
// sourceSlug `00_milestone_decoy` that WOULD match ITEM_RE — so if a geometry regression
// ever rooted the store under workDir (or named a per-import folder NN_type_slug),
// listItems would enumerate it and (a) would go RED. (b) goes RED if the store root
// landed under workDir; (c) goes RED if the store stopped being git-ignored (the
// materialized .md would show in `git status`) — exactly the drift this pins.
