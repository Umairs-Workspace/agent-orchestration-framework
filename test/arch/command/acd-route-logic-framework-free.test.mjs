// Fitness function: acd-route-logic-framework-free (m45 / ADR-001 + ADR-003 + ADR-006) —
//
//   "The route table is a PURE module: no React, no DOM, no clock, no `location` of its
//    own — so `node:test` drives the one decision this milestone exists to make. And the
//    router is a PATH router: it reads exactly one query parameter (`mode`, only to delete
//    it) and carries every other parameter and the fragment through untouched."
//
// EXPECTED RED until milestone 45's stories land: `ui/src/app/routes.mjs` does not exist.
//
// WHY PURITY IS THE STRUCTURAL RULE AND NOT A STYLE PREFERENCE. There is NO React test
// harness in this repo — no vitest, no testing-library. Every UI surface keeps its
// decisions in framework-free `.mjs` beside the component so node:test drives them
// headlessly: ui/src/fleet/scope.mjs (whose own header states the rule), ui/src/board/
// {runs,action,freshness,resync}.mjs, ui/src/board/terminal/*.mjs. The canonical shape is
// test/ui/fleet-scope.test.mjs. If the route table were JSX/hook-shaped — a router library's
// <Routes>/<Navigate>/loader config — the URL-to-surface mapping would be the one thing in
// this milestone that CANNOT be tested here. That, and not bundle size, is why m45/ADR-001
// rejects react-router-dom for a four-route surface. `scope.mjs`'s discipline is copied
// verbatim: "PURE — the caller wires this into history.pushState/replaceState; this module
// touches no `window`/`location` itself (headless-testable)."
//
// WHY THE PASSTHROUGH IS AN INVARIANT AND NOT A NICETY. `?scope=` is a live deep-link
// contract with server-side consumers (mesh-ui-serve.mjs:143 advertises it,
// queryGlobalMeshStatus honours it, ui/src/fleet/api.ts:279 sends it), and milestone 47 adds
// a repo filter beside it. The failure mode is banal and common: a router that "normalises"
// the query string and quietly drops what it does not recognise, so a deep link works right
// up until the moment it is redirected. ADR-006's rule is therefore COPY-AND-DELETE
// (preserve by default), never build-from-a-known-list (drop by default) — and the router
// never imports ui/src/fleet/scope.mjs, because the router not knowing that `scope` exists
// is exactly what makes milestone 47's change local to the fleet.
//
// THE FRAGMENT IS PART OF THE CONTRACT. `/api/mesh/board-url` returns
// `http://127.0.0.1:PORT/?mode=board#ref` (mesh-ui-serve.mjs:278), Fleet.tsx:514 navigates to
// it, and Board.tsx:585 reads the fragment back to select an item. A fragment is never sent
// to the server, so only the CLIENT can preserve it across the legacy translation — which is
// itself one of ADR-003's reasons for a client-side replaceState over a server-side 3xx.
