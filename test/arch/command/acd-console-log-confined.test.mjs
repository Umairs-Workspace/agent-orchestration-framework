// Fitness function: acd-console-log-confined (milestone 42 wave (d) leg d1;
// PRD-command-spine-effects-ledger §command-spine-faces — "`console.log` confined to
// the face", the third of d1's owed items).
//
// THE INVARIANT — printing is a FACE act, not a core act. `src/` began the wave with
// 248 console.logs in cli.mjs alone; the verb migrations moved each one into a
// `render()` that RETURNS lines, which the ONE generic face prints. What keeps it that
// way is this gate: the set of modules that may call `console.log` is CLOSED and
// declared below, and it may only ever SHRINK (the acd-silent-catch ratchet idiom —
// a sanctioned floor, not an amnesty).
//
// Why a declared floor rather than a blanket ban: three legitimate printer classes
// survive, and each is named with its reason in PRINTERS. Everything else — every
// command module, every core — reports through a value: a `render()` return, or a
// `log` collector its caller injects (the cores' defaults are NO_PRINT for exactly
// this reason, so an un-injected call is silent-by-contract rather than a second
// printer sneaking output past the face's one-document discipline).
//
// The gate is comment-blind (a comment naming console.log is not a call) and matches
// the CALL FORM `console.log(`, so a mention in a string or an identifier is not a
// match either.
