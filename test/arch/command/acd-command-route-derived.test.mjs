// Fitness functions for m42 wave (d) leg d1 (PRD-command-spine-effects-ledger):
// the CLI's route table is DERIVED from the registry — never a hand-kept ladder
// — and stays coherent as verbs migrate.
//
//   (1) deriveRouteTable derives collision-free (two commands can never claim
//       the same words — the derivation itself throws, this pins it).
//   (2) Every command declaring cli.route RESOLVES through resolveRoute to
//       itself, with the remaining argv (positionals/flags) passed through — a
//       declared route that cannot dispatch is a lie.
//   (3) A routed command carries a cli.spec with a usage line — the per-command
//       flag vocabulary is the route-table contract (no routed verb may fall
//       back to parseOptions' global allow-list).
//   (4) No group ladder re-implements a routed verb: a `subcommand === "<sub>"`
//       branch for a routed verb may exist ONLY as a delegation (it must call
//       runCommandFace) — the bare-`aof project` default spelling is the
//       sanctioned example. Anything else is a second door.
