// Fitness functions for m42 wave (d) leg d2 (PRD-command-spine-effects-ledger):
// the effects ledger's structural invariants.
//
//   (1) CLOSED VOCABULARY, WELL-FORMED TABLE: every EFFECTS entry maps an event
//       name to a frozen reactor list; every reactor carries { key, locus,
//       apply } with a KNOWN locus and an async apply — the table is executable,
//       not prose.
//   (2) ONE EVENT-RAISER: `appendEvent(` is called in src/ ONLY by the
//       transition seam(s) (run-transitions.mjs, assignment-transitions.mjs) — no command or module may
//       append events beside the fact-writer (the "no event append outside
//       transition()" rule).
//   (3) THE CRASH WINDOW CLOSES: a transition whose process dies before the
//       drain (simulated with drain:false) leaves PENDING journal steps that a
//       later drainEffects pays in full — the wave-(d) exit-criterion property,
//       pinned at the unit level (the BDD feature proves it through the CLI).
