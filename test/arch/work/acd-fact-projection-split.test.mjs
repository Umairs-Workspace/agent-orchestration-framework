// Fitness functions for m42 wave (d) leg d5 (PRD-command-spine-effects-ledger,
// "fact-projection-split"): the store epistemology is EXECUTABLE, and the last
// two crash windows the arc named are closed.
//
//   (1) TOTALITY (two-way ratchet): every table any src/ module CREATEs is
//       classified fact | projection | meta in effects/stores.mjs, and every
//       classified table is actually created somewhere. A new table cannot ship
//       unclassified; a renamed table cannot leave a stale row behind.
//   (2) WHOLESALE DELETES ARE CLASS-GATED: the row publisher's sweep routes
//       through the one guard that refuses anything but a projection table —
//       schema-level gating where a "MUST NEVER touch" comment used to stand.
//   (3) FACT WRITERS ARE ISOLATED: SQL that mutates a fact table lives only in
//       that table's declared writer module(s).
//   (4) THE REF-REMAP SPLIT (behavioural, through the real seam): the streamed
//       mirrors rewrite at `local` in the CLI's own drain; the dispatch facts
//       wait for the control-store drain (the tick's loci) and are event-id
//       deduped on their OWN watermark; a solo (non-mesh) workspace owes no
//       fact-remap step at all (the port-4 applicability machinery, reused).
//   (5) THE RECONCILER + THE DOCTOR DOORS (behavioural): a crash between the
//       run-record write and its event append is healed by `work:doctor
//       --converge` — the record's event is re-derived, the cascade pays, the
//       rollback lands. Bounded honestly: only each item's LATEST record, and
//       nothing from before the ledger's birth, is ever re-announced.
