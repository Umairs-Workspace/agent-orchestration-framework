// Fitness function: acd-work-ui-rename-complete (milestone 25 / ADR-001) — the
// "the `aof work board` → `aof work ui` rename actually happened" proof, in the
// acd-mesh-command-cli-bijection grep idiom (isolate the dispatcher body; discount
// comments; match the exact `subcommand === "<sub>"` dispatch literal).
//
// The invariant is a MUTUAL EXCLUSION over the `workCommand` body: the serve-verb
// dispatch is EITHER the old `subcommand === "board"` OR the new `subcommand === "ui"`,
// NEVER both and NEVER neither. Phrased as an XOR so it is GREEN on BOTH sides of the
// rename and RED only in the broken half-renamed states:
//   - current tree      : "board" present, "ui" absent            → XOR true  (green)
//   - post-rename tree   : "board" absent,  "ui" present           → XOR true  (green)
//   - both present       : a dead `=== "board"` branch left behind → XOR false (red)
//   - neither present    : the board serve verb vanished, no verb  → XOR false (red)
// So this test is WRITABLE now (green) and locks the rename from the Decide stage
// forward — the moment story 01 renames `board`→`ui` it stays green; the moment it
// leaves a dangling branch (or drops the verb) it reds. (ADR-001, fitness table B.)
//
// NOTE: `subcommand === "ui"` is matched ONLY inside the `workCommand` body, so any
// OTHER dispatcher's `ui` branch does NOT satisfy this work-side check — the
// dispatchers are isolated exactly as acd-mesh-command-cli-bijection isolates
// meshCommand.
//
// REWORKED with m42 wave (d) leg d1's wave-3 tail (the launcher seam): the `ui`
// serve verb's door is the ROUTE TABLE now (work:ui carries cli.route
// ["work","ui"]; its ladder branch is deleted), so the XOR runs over THREE
// candidate doors — the old `board` ladder branch, a `ui` ladder branch, and the
// routed work:ui — and exactly ONE may exist. The broken states stay red: a dead
// board branch surviving beside the route, a ladder branch shadowing the route
// (a second door), or the serve verb vanishing entirely.
