// Fitness function for milestone 00 / ADR-001:
// "The folder name is the index; content reads never identify an item."
//
// Behavioural proof (not a source grep): build a stream whose record docs are
// corrupt or absent, then assert discovery is unaffected — `listItems` still
// enumerates every folder, and `findWork` still resolves a bare number, an
// `NN/SS` pair, and a slug. If resolution ever started reading content to find
// or identify items, this fixture would make items vanish or refs miss; instead
// identity survives unreadable content, with `readMeta` yielding null
// status/title for the matched-but-corrupt item.
