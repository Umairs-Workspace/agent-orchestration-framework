// Fitness function: acd-work-items-single-writer (milestone 43 / ADR-004) —
//
//   "`work_items` stops being a disk-rebuilt projection and becomes a
//    provenance-stamped, row-upserted FACT written through ONE seam that both the
//    control node and every worker use. The effects/stores.mjs RECLASSIFICATION is the
//    enforcement: once `work_items` is classified `fact`, `wholesaleDelete` throws for
//    it, so the rebuild cannot survive the reclassification even by accident."
//
// THE DISEASE (measured; SPEC's line citations corrected by RESEARCH and re-verified
// here): `publishWorkspaceSnapshot` (global-work-store.mjs:436-504) calls
// `wholesaleDelete(db, "work_items", workspaceId)` at :459-460 — NOT SPEC.md's :431/:417
// — and re-INSERTs every row from the CALLING node's own disk slice. The control
// launcher runs this on a cadence (mesh-launcher.mjs:732); the worker's delta is merged
// by applyDeltaFrame (control-stream-server.mjs:177-202) and re-published through the
// same wholesale seam. The two writers alternate and the last tick wins; after settle the
// worker stops ticking and the control's stale disk wins permanently.
//
// WHY the reclassification is the whole enforcement: `wholesaleDelete`
// (global-work-store.mjs:45-61) looks up tableClass(table) and THROWS before running if
// the class is not "projection" — schema-level gating, not a comment. So ADR-004 needs no
// new mechanism; it needs the registry m42 built for exactly this to say the true thing.
//
// Proofs:
//  1. GREEN — every INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statement naming `work_items` in src/ lives in
//     exactly ONE module. True at HEAD (global-work-store.mjs:463 is the only one), and it
//     is precisely the property the shared upsert seam must preserve as it gains a second
//     caller (applyDeltaFrame).
//  2. GREEN — `work_item_docs` and `work_item_runs` are still classified "fact": the m42
//     leg d5 decision that is the reason streamed content survives worktree cleanup, and
//     the shape `work_items` is being migrated ONTO. A silent reclassification back to
//     "projection" would re-open the sweep on them.
//  3. ARMED AT THE CUT — read the live classification: IF `work_items` is classified
//     "fact", THEN no `wholesaleDelete(..., "work_items", ...)` call may exist anywhere in
//     src/. A clean skip while it is still "projection".
//  Self-check (m03 non-vacuous): a planted second writer module and a planted sweep call
//  trip the SAME detectors.
