// Fitness function for milestone 15 / story 03 (validate keystone wiring) —
// the @executable contract of tasks/00_doctor-after-validate.feature.
//
// The story pins entirely STATIC TEXT in a shipped doc: after this build, the
// body of src/bundle/commands/validate.md must carry an `aof work doctor
// $ARGUMENTS` invocation positioned AFTER its existing `aof work validate
// $ARGUMENTS` step, with the lane-grouped + advisory + added-not-substituted
// framing, AND must retain the pre-existing structural keystone and the
// agent-only layer (traceability / UAT-gate integrity / litmus). Every Then in
// the feature is a grep-able fact about that shipped doc body — no human
// judgement, no engine run, no render.
//
// House: acd-bundle-membership (a deterministic source-grep over a shipped
// bundle doc) and acd-design-conformance-bundled (marker-presence over a
// bundled command doc, with a self-test proving the guard trips). One assertion
// per feature scenario (and one per Scenario-Outline row).
