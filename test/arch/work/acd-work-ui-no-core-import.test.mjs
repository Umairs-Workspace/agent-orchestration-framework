// Fitness function for milestone 08 / ADR-004 inv. 3 (the registry is the only
// door): "The board surface (`src/board-ui.mjs`) imports NO work-core/operation
//  module except the command registry (`./command-core.mjs`), and performs no
//  work-operation filesystem call itself. The bespoke `handleDoc`/`handleTasks`/
//  `handleFeedback` logic and its direct `work.mjs`/`feature-parse.mjs` imports
//  moved INTO the commands (story 00); story 02 strips them from the face."
//
// Source-grep `src/board-ui.mjs` (the import-boundary idiom of
// acd-terminal-server-only, with comments discounted via the call-form discipline
// of acd-board-write-isolation):
//   - the ONLY operation-bearing import is `./command-core.mjs`;
//   - the `{ loadWorkspace, listStream, findWork, validateWork, nextWork }` import
//     FROM `./work.mjs` is ABSENT (loadWorkspace may come from ./command-core.mjs —
//     that is the door — but NOT from ./work.mjs);
//   - the `parseFeature` import from `./feature-parse.mjs` is ABSENT;
//   - no `appendFile(`/`writeFile(`/`readdir(`/`parseFeature(` call form remains
//     for the work ops (those moved to the commands).
