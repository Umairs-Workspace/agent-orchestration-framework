// the change; and it is a SEPARATE writer, never a widening of `rollbackItemStatus`.
//
// The bound the migration writer must mirror already exists and is exercised here
// ALWAYS-LIVE over the real `rollbackItemStatus` export (work.mjs:375, 20/ADR-005): it
// rewrites only the `status:` line inside the leading `---…---` block and reassembles
// every other byte — the body and every other key — unchanged. ADR-004 forbids widening
// this bounded writer into a general mutator; the migration writer is a NEW, distinct
// export that widens the SCOPE to the whole frontmatter block while keeping the body
// byte-identical. The second proof is GUARD-IF-PRESENT: once that writer lands it must
// be a separate function from `rollbackItemStatus`.
