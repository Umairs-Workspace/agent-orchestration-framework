// Fitness function for milestone 08 / ADR-004 inv. 4 (ADR-001's guard):
// "No `/api/work*` serving path spawns a subprocess to serve the operation — the
//  boundary is in-process (one shared command core), NOT a per-request shell-out
//  to `aof …`. The board face calls the registry's `invoke` in-process; it never
//  spawns the CLI to answer a work route."
//
// Source-grep `src/board-ui.mjs` (the board's `/api/work*` surface) with comments
// and strings discounted via the call-form discipline the house tests use: assert
// NO `child_process` import and NO `spawn(`/`spawnSync(`/`exec(`/`execSync(`/
// `execFile(` call form, and NO `aof <…>` CLI-invocation string on the
// work-serving path. This guard is GREEN today (no subprocess in board-ui.mjs) and
// must STAY green across the story-02 migration — the re-home must honour the
// in-process boundary, not quietly shell out per request.
