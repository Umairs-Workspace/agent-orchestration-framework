// Fitness function for milestone 41 / ADR-003 (foundation) — honours 00/ADR-001
// ("the folder name is the index; content reads never identify an item").
//
//   "Resolution is stateless and folder-derived, so RE-INDEX BY RENAME is
//    sufficient for resolution — there is no persistent index/cache to rebuild."
//
// The re-index engine (ADR-001) renumbers items purely by renaming `NN_type_slug`
// folders (+ bumping frontmatter `number` + rewriting stored `depends`/`parent`).
// The whole approach only works if `findWork`/`listItems` resolve the NEW number
// the instant the folder is renamed, with NO cache-invalidation / index-rebuild
// step. This is a BEHAVIOURAL proof (not a source grep): build a fixture, resolve
// the old numbers, RENAME the folders to new numbers (simulating a shift), and —
// with no rebuild in between — assert a FRESH resolution sees the new numbers and
// the old numbers resolve to nothing. If resolution ever grew a persistent index,
// this fixture would resolve stale numbers and the test would fail.
