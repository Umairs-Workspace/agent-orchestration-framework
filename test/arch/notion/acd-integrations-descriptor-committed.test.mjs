// Fitness function FF-A for milestone 18 / ADR-003 + ADR-006 (descriptor-is-committed-
// not-derived):
//   "Routing is read from the per-folder `.integrations.json` descriptor + the `boards`
//    config, NEVER the git-ignored sidecar; the sidecar entry shape gains NO routing
//    field (board/parent/phase). The resolver DOES read the descriptor + boards."
//
// Source-grep of src/integrations/routing.mjs + src/notion/projection.mjs +
// src/notion/mapping.mjs + src/commands/notion-associate.mjs, CI-able offline:
//   (a) NO module reads a sidecar entry's routing field — no `entries[*].(board|parent
//       |phase)` access, and no `recordPageId(... board|parent ...)` call that would
//       persist routing onto a binding; the mapping entry shape names none of them.
//   (b) The resolver (routing.mjs) DOES read the descriptor (readRouting) AND the boards
//       registry (asBoardsRegistry/boards) — routing comes from committed facts.
// The forbidden-field matcher is WORD-BOUND (`\bboard\b`) so it does NOT false-positive
// on the v2 `boards` BUCKET key that mapping.mjs uses throughout (a legitimate
// sidecar-shape key, not a per-entry routing field) — the build-note gotcha.
//   Self-checked non-vacuous: the forbidden matchers fire on a planted entry-routing form.
