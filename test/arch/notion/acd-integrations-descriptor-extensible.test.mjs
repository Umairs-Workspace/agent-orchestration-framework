// Fitness function FF-E for milestone 18 / ADR-003 (provider-namespaced + extensible):
//   The `.integrations.json` reader (src/integrations/routing.mjs `readRouting`)
//   TOLERATES an unknown provider key — a planted `jira` block (a future provider) is
//   IGNORED, not a hard failure: the reader returns the `notion` routing and does not
//   throw. Routing is provider-namespaced; a non-`notion` peer is additive.
//
// Driven over a temp fixture (the registry-driven temp-fixture idiom) — a behaviour
// fitness, not a source-grep, so a future reader that hard-fails on an unknown provider
// (or stops returning notion when a peer is present) fails HERE. Supersedes the
// extensibility intent of acd-notion-parents-schema (the closedness half moves to FF-F).
