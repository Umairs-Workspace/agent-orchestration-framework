// Fitness function for milestone 17 / ADR-001 (inv. 1):
//   "Mapping-sidecar-only. The aof↔Notion mapping lives ONLY in the git-ignored
//    `.aof/` sidecar keyed by aof ref; no code writes an aof-identity property onto a
//    Notion page and no code issues a resolve-by-query to find a page (the sidecar is
//    the sole resolver)."
//
// RE-POINTED (18/ADR-005, story 01) to the v2 multi-board per-data-source sidecar
// shape: the invariant ("a binding under one data-source does not resolve under another")
// now holds at the BUCKET boundary (separate per-data-source buckets in one file), not
// because the file is single-scope. The round-trip arm additionally proves the v2
// no-clobber guarantee (recording board B leaves board A's bucket intact) and that the
// persisted file is v2 shape.
//
// Two legs, both CI-able offline (no Notion, no spawn):
//   (a) ROUND-TRIP: import readMapping/resolvePageId/recordPageId and prove, over an
//       injected temp project root, a MISS → null then a HIT → the recorded pageId; the
//       per-board scoping holds (a ds-A binding misses under ds-B); and recording a
//       SECOND board's binding leaves the FIRST board's bucket intact (the v2 coexistence
//       fix) — the persisted file is v2 shape. The sidecar is the SOLE identity store.
//   (b) SOURCE-GREP src/notion/*: (i) the sidecar file name is in AOF_GITIGNORE_ENTRIES
//       (the mapping is git-ignored, ADR-001); (ii) no Notion `filter`-by-id resolve
//       query appears (no resolve-by-query to FIND a page); (iii) no aof-identity
//       property write — the only page-property writes name title / status / relation.
//       Self-checked non-vacuous: the forbidden-form matchers fire on a planted form.
