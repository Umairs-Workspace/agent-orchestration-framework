// Fitness functions for m42 wave (d) leg d4, PORT 4 (PRD-command-spine-effects-
// ledger, "cascade-ports"): the Notion status sync is a LEDGERED CONSEQUENCE,
// with an APPLICABILITY PREDICATE deciding what is owed at append time.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES. Forgetting to run `aof work integrations notion
// sync-work` after a run completed was INVISIBLE — nothing anywhere recorded
// that the board no longer matches the stream. Now a completion in a
// Notion-configured workspace owes a durable `integration:notion` step. WHO PAYS
// IT is the port's recorded operator decision (2026-07-31): `autoSync: true` ⇒
// the completion's own drain reaches the integration locus and syncs in place;
// absent ⇒ the step stays deferred until the sync-work verb — the operator's
// "do Notion egress now" door — drains it. And the NEW TABLE MACHINERY: a
// consequence that can never apply (no Notion config at all; the worker's
// no-workspace sites) is NOT OWED — evaluated once, by every seam, at append
// time — because a step at a locus nobody drains would otherwise accumulate in
// the journal forever.
//
//   (1) STRUCTURAL — one body, one door, uniform seams: the sync core
//       (`syncMilestoneWork`) is reachable only from the verb + the ledger's
//       reactor; the apply layer + spawn seam are reachable only from the core;
//       every transition seam resolves its reactors through applicableReactors.
//   (2) THE PREDICATE (behavioural, through the REAL seam): an unconfigured
//       workspace's completion materialises NO notion step (non-vacuous: the
//       configured twin materialises it, deferred, with zero egress).
//   (3) RECORD-ONLY → THE VERB PAYS (behavioural): the owed step survives the
//       completion, then `notion:sync-work` drains it — `drained` rides the
//       envelope, the step goes done, and the reactor's own re-projection is a
//       sidecar-deduped no-op (zero egress beyond the verb's own sync).
//   (4) AUTOSYNC (behavioural): with `autoSync: true` the completion itself
//       syncs (spy sees the create egress, the step is done in the same drain),
//       and a SECOND completion over unchanged disk issues ZERO further egress
//       (the lastStatus/lastContentHash dedup — at-least-once redelivery safe).
//   (5) CONTAINMENT: an integration:* step never rides the outbox (workspace-
//       scoped, not node-scoped), and the unscoped crash-recovery sweep does not
//       let a deferred integration backlog consume its fetch window.
