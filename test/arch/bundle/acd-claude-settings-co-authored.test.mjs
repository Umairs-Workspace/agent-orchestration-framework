// Fitness function: acd-claude-settings-co-authored (milestone 43 / ADR-002) —
//
//   "`.claude/settings.json` is a CO-AUTHORED file: aof splices only its own
//    self-identifying hook entry through a read-overlay-write merge, and the whole-file
//    render path is CLOSED for it. A whole-file render is correct exactly when aof
//    EXCLUSIVELY owns the file."
//
// THE DEFECT THIS GATES (verified from source at HEAD, not merely reported):
// `src/render-plan.mjs:13-49` gates drift protection on a PRIOR LOCK ENTRY. For a file
// that exists on disk with NO prior entry — exactly this repo's hand-authored
// `.claude/settings.json`, which the bundle has never written (0 manifest entries) —
// every guard is skipped and the code falls through to
//   actions.push(action("update", output, prior ? "…" : "existing file will be overwritten"))
// an UNGATED overwrite: no --force, no drift warning. The content that would be written
// is `claudeSettingsJson({hooks, settings})` (src/runtime-config.mjs:21-28), which builds
// the ENTIRE body from config.hooks + config.settings and nothing else — dropping the
// operator's permissions/sandbox/plugins and four hand-wired hook events.
//
// It is DORMANT, not absent: `.aof/aof.config.json` has no `hooks` and no `settings`
// key, so `renderRuntimeConfigOutputs` (src/adapters.mjs:101-111) emits nothing today.
// It ARMS the moment this milestone adds a claude-runtime hook — which is why proof 3
// is keyed on exactly that condition. This is m42 leg d4's `writeLock` defect verbatim:
// one writer assuming sole ownership of a document with several authors.
//
// Proofs:
//  1. GREEN, a canary — the operator's top-level keys and four hand-wired hook events are
//     still present. A wholesale render would delete every one of them, so this fires on
//     the damage even if the mechanism changes shape.
//  2. GREEN — the 34-file bundle manifest carries ZERO `.claude/settings.json` entry: the
//     whole-file, content-hashed installer never writes this file (and must not start).
//  3. ARMED AT THE HAZARD — IF `.aof/aof.config.json` declares a claude-runtime hook or a
//     `settings.claude` entry, THEN `src/adapters.mjs` must not render the file whole-file
//     (no `claudeSettingsJson(` call reachable from the render pipeline) and a merge writer
//     must exist. A clean skip while the config declares neither.
//  Self-check (m03 non-vacuous): a planted claude-hook config trips the hazard detector,
//  and a planted wholesale-rendered settings body fails the key canary.
