// Fitness function for milestone 40 / ADR-008 — reconstruction is NOT migration. The
// registry MUST be able to mark a reconstructed doc so it can never be recalled as an
// authored fact; the pure stamp transform sets NO such marker. This is the readiness
// criterion for m39's OUTCOME.md backfill: a registry that cannot express the
// distinction is not ready to carry it.
//
// The honest precedent already exists ALWAYS-LIVE: the import leg marks a recovered
// digest `imported: true` and `isImportRecord` (memory/local-indexing.mjs) routes those
// records to a soft `summary`, never a hard `adr`/`lesson`. A `reconstructed` marker is
// the exact analogue. This guard proves (a) that recall-exclusion idiom exists to build
// on, ALWAYS-LIVE, and (b) GUARD-IF-PRESENT, that the registry can express a
// reconstructed transform whose produced doc carries the marker.
