// Fitness function for milestone 40 / ADR-005 — `aof upgrade` is idempotent: running
// it twice is a no-op the second time, and a stamped-current item is left untouched.
//
// The structural guarantee of idempotency lives in the registry SHAPE: no transform may
// apply to an item already at the current schema. Because every transform advances the
// schema and the highest target EQUALS WORK_ITEM_SCHEMA_VERSION (acd-work-item-schema-
// single-constant), a current item (schema === current) matches NO transform, so a
// second `aof upgrade` selects an empty chain and writes nothing. This is proven at the
// data level (API-independent, durable) — the behavioural "run twice = no-op" is the
// concern of story 02's .feature over the real engine.
//
// GUARD-IF-PRESENT: a clean no-op until src/work/upgrade.mjs exists; arms on build.
