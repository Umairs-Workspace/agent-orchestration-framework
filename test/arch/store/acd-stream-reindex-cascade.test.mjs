// Fitness functions for m42 wave (d) leg d4, PORT 3 (PRD-command-spine-effects-
// ledger: "insert/reindex emits `stream.reindexed` (run-record refs, Notion
// sidecar, projection remap) — the silent page mis-binding dies").
//
// THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES. `aof work insert-*` opens a slot by renaming folders and
// rewriting the `depends`/`parent` values that name the moved numbers, and stops
// there. But an item's REF is the join key of six other stores, and the renumber
// told none of them:
//
//   run records      keep stamping the ref the item used to have;
//   the Notion map   keeps binding `03 -> <pageId>`, so the next sync PATCHes that
//                    page with whatever item is `03` NOW — content written onto
//                    another item's page, silently (the measured symptom);
//   the projection   keeps its streamed doc/run rows, assignment rows and item
//                    branches keyed on refs that have moved.
//
// The cure is the arc's: DECLARE the consequence. `stream.reindexed` carries the
// OLD → NEW list as its own evidence — it must, because after the renames the old
// refs exist nowhere to be re-derived from.
//
//   (1) THE ENGINE HANDS OVER THE MAP: reindexForInsert returns the remap it
//       computed pre-rename, including the CASCADE (a story's ref changes when its
//       milestone moves, though its own folder never does), collision-free ordered.
//   (2) THE REINDEX IS REACHABLE ONLY THROUGH THE SEAM (no renumber without its
//       event), and the event declares all three remaps at reachable loci.
//   (3) THE MIS-BINDING DIES (behavioural, end-to-end through `invoke`): after an
//       insert that shifts a bound item, the sidecar binds the NEW ref to the page,
//       and the shifted item's run records say the new ref.
//   (4) THE PERMUTATION IS DEDUPED: a redelivered event does not shift everything a
//       second time. A ref remap is not idempotent, so this is the reactor
//       contract's other sanctioned option and it must actually hold.
