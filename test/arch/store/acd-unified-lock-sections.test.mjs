// Fitness function for milestone 02 / ADR-009:
// "A project has exactly ONE .aof/*.lock.json (aof.lock.json). Every writer
//  preserves the sections it does not own: `aof planning init` writes only the
//  `planning` section, `aof work init`/`update` write only the `work` section,
//  `aof assets apply` / `packages` write only the flat asset fields — and none
//  reconstructs the lock from a fixed field set (read-merge-write)."
//
// This is the unifying single-lock / foreign-section-preservation invariant the
// SPEC and STORY call for. A BEHAVIOURAL proof is strongest: run a sequence of
// real writers into one temp repo and assert that, throughout, there is exactly
// one lock file and every section survives intact.
//
// RED until the developer migrates every writer to read-merge-write the unified
// lock (planning init → `planning`; work init/update → `work`; assets apply via
// createLockManifest + writeLock, and mergeFrameworkInstallAttempts, must spread
// the current lock and replace only their own keys). That red is expected.
//
//  Case 1 — sequence: `work init` → `planning init` → asset-apply write into ONE
//    repo; assert readdir(.aof) shows only aof.lock.json AND the `work`, `planning`,
//    and flat asset fields all survive intact end-to-end.
//  Case 2 — focused: the asset-apply write path carries a pre-seeded `planning` +
//    `work` through unchanged (the createLockManifest/writeLock seam is the one that
//    today reconstructs from a fixed field set and would DROP foreign sections).
