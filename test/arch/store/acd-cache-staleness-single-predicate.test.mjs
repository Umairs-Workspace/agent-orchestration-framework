// Fitness function: acd-cache-staleness-single-predicate (milestone 43 / ADR-006) —
//
//   "The staleness predicate is the shared strict-`>` isStale, with exactly ONE
//    client-side evaluator and NO threshold literal in ui/. And the TTL NEVER EVICTS —
//    no deletion, anywhere, may be predicated on time."
//
// TWO invariants, one file, because they are the same decision seen from two sides.
//
// (1) ONE PREDICATE. DESIGN states it as a defect, not a preference: "Two staleness
// predicates that can disagree about the same instant is a defect, not a variant." The
// mesh already shares ONE definition — isStale (run-store.mjs), re-exposed as isNodeStale
// (mesh-presence.mjs:398-408), strict `>`, injected clock — and 35/ADR-005 + 38/ADR-002
// already bind the run layer, the node layer and session TTL to it. This milestone adds
// the CACHE layer, and adds a genuinely new wrinkle: DESIGN requires the badge to be
// computed against a live 1-second clock tick in the BROWSER (the board only re-polls
// while something is executing, so a settled stale item would otherwise never grow its
// badge). So the rule really is evaluated on two sides of the wire — which is safe only
// if the THRESHOLD travels on the envelope and ui/ carries no default and no literal.
//
// (2) NEVER EVICT. STATE, settled by the operator: "a TTL that evicts would destroy the
// mesh's only readable copy: after settle the artifacts exist in exactly two places, the
// pushed branch and the control's cache, and this milestone deliberately does not read
// git." A time-predicated DELETE is therefore not a tuning choice — it is the one change
// that would lose data irrecoverably. This is the ratchet.
//
// (3) ONE MAPPER — ADDED at 43/04's structural review (ADR-014/E4). ADR-006's third clause
// is the one this file did not carry: "the storage→wire mapping has ONE home — the row
// mapper — and is applied identically to rows and to artifacts." That was asserted
// BEHAVIOURALLY by the story (a row and an artifact produce the same key names), which can
// only ever prove that the mapper's OUTPUT agrees with itself at one call site — it cannot
// see a SECOND translation living somewhere else and quietly disagreeing. Measured at the
// review: one did (`mergeWorkerItems` set `reportedBy` from the ASSIGNMENT overlay's node —
// a different fact under the same wire key), and its correctness depended entirely on a
// later stamp overwriting it. That is a sameness property, so it is a ratchet, not a
// scenario.
//
// Proofs:
//  1. GREEN, behavioural — the shared predicate is strict `>`: a record AT the threshold
//     is still FRESH. Both sides of the wire must agree at that instant.
//  2. GREEN, the never-evict ratchet — no DELETE against work_items / work_item_docs /
//     work_item_runs anywhere in src/ carries a time-column predicate.
//  3. GREEN — ui/ carries at most ONE module that evaluates freshness, and NO hard-coded
//     staleness threshold (the window arrives on the wire).
//  3b. GREEN — the SUBJECT half of the same clause, added at 43/04's SECOND-PASS review
//     (ADR-015/F1). Proof 3 keys entirely on the identifier `stalenessSeconds`, so it holds
//     "only one module knows the window's WIRE NAME" and nothing more: a second evaluator
//     that takes the number as `windowSeconds` (which is exactly what every consumer in
//     ui/ already calls it) mentions `stalenessSeconds` nowhere and passes. MEASURED at the
//     review: a planted `now - Date.parse(row.syncedAt) > windowSeconds * 1000` in a .tsx
//     was invisible to every clause in this file. So the invariant is re-stated over the
//     one thing a second evaluator CANNOT avoid — reading the INSTANT: only freshness.mjs
//     may read `syncedAt` off a record. Passing the whole record to the ramp is not a read,
//     which is what every legitimate consumer does.
//  4. ARMED — once ui/src/board/freshness.mjs exists it takes `now` as a parameter, reads
//     no clock of its own, and uses strict `>` (never `>=`).
//  5. THE ONE-MAPPER RATCHET — no module in src/ other than cache-provenance.mjs may build
//     a `reportedBy`/`syncedAt` wire key out of a STORAGE spelling; one named baseline.
//  Self-check (m03 non-vacuous): a planted time-predicated DELETE, a planted ui threshold
//  literal, a `>=` predicate, a planted hand-rolled mapping AND a renamed second evaluator
//  all trip the SAME detectors.
