// Fitness functions for m42 — THE SHARED-STORE CONCURRENCY PRAGMAS.
//
// The measured residual (STATE 2026-07-27, "CONTINUOUS `ERR_SQLITE_ERROR:
// database is locked`, every ~5s post-restart"): the global work projection is
// opened by SEVERAL PROCESSES AT ONCE — the desktop's status poll, the board's
// in-flight re-poll, the serve daemon's write ticks and every CLI invocation —
// and it was opened with NO pragmas at all. In `journal_mode: delete` with no
// `busy_timeout`, a write that collides with another process's write fails
// IMMEDIATELY. Nothing was lost (ticks retry next cycle) but any tick could
// silently skip a beat, which is the same class of invisible degradation m42
// exists to kill.
//
//   (1) STRUCTURAL RATCHET: every shared-process SQLite store in src/ applies
//       both concurrency pragmas at open. A new store — or a refactor that
//       drops the call — fails here rather than on a live soak at 3am.
//   (2) BEHAVIOURAL: the real store, opened through its real door, reports
//       `wal` and a non-zero busy_timeout.
//   (3) THE DEFECT ITSELF, CROSS-PROCESS: a second process holding a write
//       transaction no longer costs the writer its beat — it waits and then
//       succeeds. Non-vacuous by construction: the SAME collision under the
//       PRE-FIX pragmas is asserted to fail, so this lane cannot pass green on
//       a machine that simply never contends.
//
// Why cross-process: `node:sqlite`'s DatabaseSync is SYNCHRONOUS, so an
// in-process holder can never release while the waiter blocks the event loop —
// an in-process version of lane (3) is structurally incapable of reproducing
// the defect and would assert nothing. The three real contenders are three real
// processes, and so is this proof.
