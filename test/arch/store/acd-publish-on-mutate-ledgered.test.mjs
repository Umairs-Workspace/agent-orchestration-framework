// Fitness functions for m42 wave (d) leg d4, PORT 1 (PRD-command-spine-effects-
// ledger, "cascade-ports"): publish-on-mutate is a LEDGERED CONSEQUENCE, not a
// per-command import decision.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES. Whether a mutation propagated its workspace to the
// global projection was decided by whether that command's author remembered to
// import `withGlobalWorkPropagation` and wrap the return value. Three verbs did;
// every other mutation did not, and nothing said so. That is wave (d)'s disease
// exactly — the consequence living at whichever call site needed it first — and
// the cure is the same as run-completion's: DECLARE it. `publish-projection` is
// now one reactor in src/effects/table.mjs, hung off the events the transition
// seams raise, and a command can neither forget it nor opt itself out.
//
//   (1) THE WRAPPER IS GONE. `withGlobalWorkPropagation` exists nowhere in src/
//       — a ratchet, because its return-value shape is what made per-command
//       publishing possible in the first place.
//   (2) ONE PUBLISH DOOR. `publishGlobalWorkSnapshot(` is called in src/ only by
//       the publisher itself, the effects table's reactor, and the two sanctioned
//       NON-cascade publishers (the verb whose whole purpose is publishing, and
//       the launcher's periodic propagation tick). No command may publish on its
//       own authority.
//   (3) THE EVENTS DECLARE IT. Every event a mutation seam raises for a
//       propagating fact carries the publish reactor at `local` locus, and the
//       reactor is the SAME function for all of them (one home, not a copy per
//       event).
//   (4) THE WARNING STILL REACHES THE RESULT (behavioural). The recorded decision
//       for this port is that the face threads the reactor's warning back rather
//       than letting the ported verbs' --json change shape: a failing publish
//       surfaces as `propagationWarnings` on the command result, exactly as the
//       retired wrapper made it. Proven end-to-end through invoke() for BOTH
//       ported verbs, with the publish injected to fail.
