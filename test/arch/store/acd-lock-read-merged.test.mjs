// Fitness function: acd-lock-read-merged (milestone 42 wave (d) leg d4;
// PRD-command-spine-effects-ledger §"Cascades have no home" — "Two `aof init` /
// `project migrate` sites bypass `writeLock`'s read-merge and wipe the `work` /
// `planning` lock sections wholesale").
//
// THE INVARIANT — the install lock has SEVERAL writers and no owner, so every one
// of them must read-merge. `aof init` and `project migrate` author the
// items/runtimes half; `work init` writes `lock.work`; `planning init` writes
// `lock.planning`. The first two wrote the WHOLE document, so running either
// against a workspace that already had work or planning installed silently
// deleted the other subtree — the manifests were gone and the next `work update`
// had nothing to reconcile against. This is the same class as the mesh sidecar's
// one-writer-per-subtree rule (writeSidecarPatch), and it gets the same cure.
//
// Two proofs, because either alone is weak:
//   (a) STRUCTURAL — no module writes the lock file through a raw text write; the
//       lock is written through lock.mjs. A grep-only gate would pass a module
//       that merges wrongly, so:
//   (b) BEHAVIOURAL — mergeLock over a lock carrying `work` and `planning` keeps
//       both byte-equivalent while replacing the keys the patch names, and an
//       absent or TORN lock is a fresh install rather than a crash.
