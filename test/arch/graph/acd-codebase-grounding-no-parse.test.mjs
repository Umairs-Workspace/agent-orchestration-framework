// Fitness function for milestone 11 / ADR-001 + ADR-006 inv. 1 (no-parse /
// legible-output):
// "No 11 seam parses `graph:query`/`graph:triage` `stdout` into a data shape, and
//  no 11-introduced `src/` module reads `graph.json` / imports `normalizeGraph`/
//  `readGraph`. The grounding is agent-consumed command OUTPUT — the agent RUNS
//  `aof graph query|triage` and READS the legible markdown; aof never destructures
//  it. (An agent CAN read graphify's markdown answer; 10's PROGRAM consumer could
//  not, hence ITS structured reads — but 11 has no program consumer.)"
//
// Two halves, mirroring the 09/10 house idiom:
//   (a) PROMPT-CONTENT (the three wired bundle seams): each grounding step instructs
//       the agent to RUN `aof graph query|triage` and READ the output, and carries an
//       explicit NO-PARSE directive over the markdown (never parse the answer / never
//       read graph.json for structure). No aof-side JSON.parse/regex is wired over the
//       command output (the seams are prompt text — they contain no parse code).
//   (b) IMPORT-GRAPH (the src/ surface): the ONLY src/ modules that read graph.json /
//       import normalizeGraph/readGraph are the EXISTING 09 readers (graphify.mjs,
//       graph-normalize.mjs, graph-build.mjs, graph-query.mjs, graph-triage.mjs,
//       graph-mcp-server.mjs) and 10's memory backend (memory/graphify-backend.mjs).
//       11 added NO new such module — the assertion is that NONE beyond this frozen
//       allow-list appears.
