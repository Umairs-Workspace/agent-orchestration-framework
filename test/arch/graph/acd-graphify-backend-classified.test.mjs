// Fitness function for milestone 10 / ADR-003:
// "`claude-cli` is classified HONESTLY and never a silent network default:
//  classifyEgress('claude-cli') === 'docs-media' (the doc/media hop ran) and
//  isNetworkBackend('claude-cli') === true (it crosses the network — billed-to-plan
//  is NOT on-box), and that network classification is BY KNOWLEDGE
//  (isKnownNetworkBackend('claude-cli') === true), not the unknown-name fall-through.
//  `ollama` stays the ONLY data-local backend (isNetworkBackend('ollama') === false)
//  yet still egresses 'docs-media' (the hop ran). The graphify backend SURFACES the
//  chosen extraction backend + its honest egress label in `status` — the selection is
//  visible, never silent."
//
// Pure-function test over the REAL exported classifiers in src/commands/graph-build.mjs
// (no live binary — the classifiers are pure functions of the backend name) PLUS a
// behavioural read of the graphify backend's `status` surface (it reaches NO binary
// over an isolated, empty projectRoot). The live `--backend claude-cli` build itself
// is @manual (evidenced in this milestone's VERIFICATION.md, story 00's reindex run);
// CI asserts only the aof-side classification + surfacing.
