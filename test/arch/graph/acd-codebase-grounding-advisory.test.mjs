// Fitness function for milestone 11 / ADR-004 + ADR-006 inv. 3 (advisory-only / no
// auto-act):
// "No `graph:*` output from any 11 seam feeds a gate / merge / status-write /
//  work-mutation; the grounding is read-and-inject into agent CONTEXT only. The agent
//  decides; the graph informs. Concretely: the architect/refine/code-review grounding
//  steps inject graph output into the agent's context as a consider/cite instruction;
//  no seam wires graph output into a CI gate, the code-review merge decision
//  (`work.codeReview.autoComplete`), or a STORY.md/SPEC.md/STATE.md status/work write.
//  The triage queue is ranking context for the reviewer, never an auto-block input."
//
// This is the milestone's load-bearing invariant (SPEC §Out of scope). The house
// idiom is source-grep over the BUNDLED seams (markdown read as text). The assertion
// is ROBUST — not one magic word: each seam must carry BOTH the advisory-and-inform
// property (informs/consider/cite + an explicit advisory-only framing) AND the
// no-auto-act property (never auto-fail/auto-block/auto-rewrite; merge gate unchanged;
// no graph output piped into a gate/merge/status-write).
