// "Where a `graph:*` result carries graph-derived structured data it is normalized
//  from `graph.json` — NetworkX `links` (NOT `edges`); `confidence`/
//  `confidenceScore` preserved (score ONLY for INFERRED); `graph.hyperedges` kept
//  SEPARATE (never flattened into edges). graphify's markdown `stdout` is opaque,
//  never parsed for data. `graph:query`/`graph:triage` carry NO graph-derived
//  structured field — only opaque `stdout` + `graphPath`."
//
// Fixture-driven (RESEARCH §A1/A2 @executable): feed the real committed
// test/fixtures/graph/graph.json (+ a captured markdown stdout) through the
// normalizer (normalizeGraph/readGraph from src/graphify.mjs) and assert the
// structural facts hold against the LANDED code.
