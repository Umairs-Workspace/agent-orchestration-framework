// Fitness function for milestone 10 / ADR-001:
// "The graphify backend's `recall` returns records produced by the 05 markdown
//  parsers (each a frozen `MemoryRecord` with a resolving `source:line`), NEVER
//  records synthesised from `graph.json` nodes; the graph contributes ONLY to
//  `score`. The re-ranker is a PURE function of (records, normalizedGraph, query,
//  scope) that re-ranks-not-replaces: the returned set is exactly the base-ranked
//  candidate set (same record ids), only the ORDER and the numeric `score` change,
//  and NO field is added to a MemoryRecord beyond `score`."
//
// Mirrors the 05 `acd-memory-recall-contract` idiom, applied to the graphify backend.
// Two halves, BOTH CI-able with NO live binary:
//   (a) records-from-the-05-parsers: build the graphify store over a temp .md stream
//       via the REAL backend `reindex` (records ⇐ buildRecords, the 05 parser), then
//       `recall` over it with a committed normalized graph.json injected — assert every
//       returned record carries exactly MEMORY_RECORD_FIELDS + a numeric score, and its
//       `source` (path:line) resolves to live text whose heading NAMES the record id
//       (the F-1 strength; a graph node could only yield <file>:1, never this).
//   (b) graph-contributes-only-to-score: drive the pure re-ranker over the committed
//       fixtures with the graph PRESENT vs ABSENT — the record-id SET is identical
//       (re-rank, never source-from-graph), only score/order differ, and no record
//       carries a field outside MEMORY_RECORD_FIELDS ∪ {score}.
