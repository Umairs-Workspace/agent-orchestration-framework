// Fitness function: acd-directive-targets-one-peer (milestone 35 / ADR-002, fitness
// #5) — "A node-targeted directive is sent to a SINGLE connected peer socket, never
// broadcast."
//
// Proofs:
//  1. Structural — over control-stream-server.mjs, assert the directive send
//     resolves ONE socket from the nodeId -> ws targeting map (a `.get(nodeId)` /
//     map lookup) and that no directive send iterates `wss.clients` / a "send to
//     all" fan-out branch; sendDirective has no broadcast branch.
//  2. Behavioural — with a two-worker registry, sendDirective("worker-a", …) writes
//     to worker-a's socket only, worker-b's socket receives nothing.
//  3. Self-check (m03 non-vacuous planted-violation) — a planted
//     `for (const c of wss.clients) c.send(directive)` fails the no-fan-out
//     assertion the real (clean) source passes.
