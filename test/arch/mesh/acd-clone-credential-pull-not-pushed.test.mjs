// Fitness function: acd-clone-credential-pull-not-pushed (milestone 38 / ADR-009 —
// arming ADR-005's deferred credential MECHANISM, RESEARCH §1/A4, SECURITY T1–T4, and
// re-arming ADR-008's producer-vs-fixture rule at the wiring seam)
//
// THE DECISION (ADR-009): the clone credential is PULLED by the worker at the moment it
// actually hits a clone miss — never PUSHED down the directive path. Three structural
// consequences, all encoded here:
//
//  (1) THE FROZEN DIRECTIVE FRAME STAYS FROZEN. `buildDirectiveFrame` remains EXACTLY the
//      five keys 35/ADR-002 froze — { kind, to, assignmentId, itemRef, workspaceId, at }.
//      A credential key on the directive is forbidden: ~every directive needs NO clone (the
//      worker usually already holds the repo), so a credential on the directive is the
//      broadest exposure for the least benefit, and it would break a frozen contract.
//
//  (2) NO CREDENTIAL IS MINTED OR SENT ON THE DIRECTIVE DISPATCH PATH. Control CANNOT know
//      whether a clone is even needed: the deciding fact (`localMeshRepoPublished` — the
//      worker's own on-disk `mesh.repo.published` marker) is readable ONLY on the worker
//      ("the control-side gate ... has no filesystem access to a remote worker's config",
//      mesh-worker-execution.mjs:149-152). So any PUSH design must mint SPECULATIVELY, on
//      every directive — which is per-DIRECTIVE, not the "per-clone ... minted for one
//      assignment, not reused" SECURITY T4 requires. The directive send path
//      (buildDirectiveFrame / sendDirective / dispatchDirectiveOverTargets) must therefore
//      name no credential at all.
//
//  (3) THE CREDENTIAL COLLABORATOR MUST BE PRODUCTION-WIRED — THE F12 GUARD (ADR-008).
//      F12: `mesh-worker-execution.mjs` consumed a `cloneCredential` option, but the ONLY
//      production constructor (`mesh-launcher.mjs`'s `createHandler({...})`) never supplied
//      it — every path to it ran through `...(options?.workerExecutionOptions ?? {})`, a
//      documented TEST-INJECTION seam. The GIT_ASKPASS machinery was fully built and fully
//      green, and could still only ever clone a PUBLIC repo in production. This is ADR-008's
//      defect class again: a component validated against a fixture (an injected fake token),
//      never against its real producer (the launcher, which supplied nothing). The guard:
//        (a) the production call site must NEVER supply a STATIC credential (a token value on
//            the handler's options is per-handler, i.e. per-worker-process — the opposite of
//            per-clone; ADR-009 mandates an async per-clone RESOLVER instead); and
//        (b) ANY credential-shaped collaborator the handler consumes must appear as a LITERAL
//            key at the production call site, not merely be reachable through the
//            test-injection spread. The legacy static `cloneCredential` option is DELETED
//            outright (not merely exempted): a static string is per-HANDLER and therefore
//            structurally cannot be per-clone — SECURITY T4's invariant, enforced by the
//            SHAPE of the seam (an async resolver, called fresh on every clone-miss), not a
//            comment asking politely. The detector still names the legacy option (below) as a
//            defensive, permanently-forbidden shape — clause (a) trips on it unconditionally —
//            but nothing in the shipped source destructures it any more.
//      Clause (b) arms the moment the developer lands the resolver: a resolver that exists but
//      is only test-injectable is exactly F12 again, and fails CI.
//
// Proofs:
//  1. Behavioural, against the REAL producer — `buildDirectiveFrame` returns exactly the five
//     frozen keys, order-sensitive, with no credential key (for a directive carrying extra
//     input).
//  2. Structural — the directive build/dispatch path in `control-stream-server.mjs` names no
//     credential/token/secret (no push, no mint on that path).
//  3. Structural — the production wiring guard (3a/3b above), read from the ACTUAL
//     `createHandler({...})` call site in `mesh-launcher.mjs` and the ACTUAL option
//     destructuring in `mesh-worker-execution.mjs`.
//  Self-check (m03 non-vacuous): a SYNTHESIZED credential key on the directive frame, a
//  SYNTHESIZED mint/credential-send on the dispatch path, a SYNTHESIZED static credential at
//  the production call site, and — the F12 shape itself — a SYNTHESIZED resolver that is
//  consumed by the handler but reachable ONLY through the `workerExecutionOptions` test
//  spread, ALL trip the detector; the correct PULL wiring (resolver as a literal key at the
//  production call site) stays clean. Every plant is built from a hand-written minimal
//  snippet (see the "SELF-CHECK PLANT PLUMBING" block below), never a string-replace on the
//  real files — so a correct refactor of the real files (deleting the legacy option, exactly
//  as this ADR mandates) can never silently turn a plant into a no-op again.

// SELF-CHECK PLANT PLUMBING — SYNTHESIZED sources, never a string-replace on the REAL

// The self-check below used to plant violations by `.replace()`-ing literal
// substrings of the ACTUAL `mesh-launcher.mjs` / `mesh-worker-execution.mjs` source.
// That coupled the plants to production TEXT that a correct refactor is free (and, in
// ADR-009's case, REQUIRED) to change — deleting the legacy static `cloneCredential`
// option is exactly such a refactor, and it silently turned a plant's `.replace()`
// into a no-op (the search string no longer existed), which the "did the plant
// actually rewrite the source" guard then correctly (and unhelpfully) failed on. A
// self-check whose non-vacuity depends on a specific implementation shape surviving
// forever is backwards: the DETECTOR is what must be proven robust, not the
// production source's exact bytes.
//
// The fix: build the violating (and clean/negative-control) shapes ourselves, as
// minimal hand-written snippets carrying only the ANCHOR TEXT the detector functions
// above actually key on (`export function buildDirectiveFrame`, `createHandler(`,
// `export function createMeshWorkerExecutionHandler`, …) — never derived from the
// real files at all. This is what the coordinator asked for: "build the violating
// shape yourself and feed it to the detector."
//
// Two disciplines carried over from the original string-replace plants, both still
// load-bearing:
//   (1) EVERY plant still asserts it actually differs from its own clean baseline
//       (`assert.notEqual(planted, clean)`) before asserting the detector trips —
//       now guarding against a copy/paste mistake in the plant's OWN construction
//       (e.g. accidentally passing the same shape to both sides) rather than a
//       failed string search, but the same "a plant that didn't land proves
//       nothing" principle.
//   (2) Every snippet is built with EXPLICIT "\n" line joins (Array#join("\n")),
//       never a raw multi-line template literal — so its runtime shape is immune to
//       the repo's own CRLF checkout convention, the SAME hazard `lf()` guards
//       against for the real files, closed here at the source instead of by
