// Fitness function: acd-clone-credential-relay-not-logged (milestone 38 / ADR-009 +
// SECURITY T3, re-derived on the NEW relay-borne credential frame)
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS — T3 was written before the credential ever crossed the relay. As of
// ADR-009 the credential is a live field on TWO frames that flow through code paths T3's
// original fitness (`acd-worker-clone-no-credential-persisted`, scoped to
// `mesh-worker-execution.mjs`) never looked at:
//   - control-stream-server.mjs — `buildCloneCredentialFrame(...)` mints the DOWN-frame
//     `{ kind:"clone-credential", to, assignmentId, credential, at }`; the token is a
//     literal field on that object.
//   - worker-stream-client.mjs — `requestCloneCredential(...)` / `settleCloneCredential
//     Request(...)` RECEIVE that frame and read `frame.credential`.
// The single likeliest future regression on this surface is a debugging line —
// `console.log(frame)` in the receive path, `onWarning({ message: credential })` on a
// refusal, `logger.debug("minted", credential)` at the mint — any of which streams a live
// token into a run record / console / warning sink a passive attacker with log access
// harvests (SECURITY T3 · Info-disclosure). Neither module logs a credential today; this
// pins that both STAY log-free of the credential value.
//
// THE INVARIANT (structural, over both relay modules): no `console.*` / `logger.*` /
// `warn(...)` / `onWarning(...)` call in control-stream-server.mjs or worker-stream-
// client.mjs passes a `credential` value. (The frame is written to the WIRE via
// `ws.send(JSON.stringify(frame))` — that is transport, not a log, and is not matched.)
//
// Self-check (m03 non-vacuous, milestone-38 hard lesson): every plant is a SYNTHESIZED
// snippet built with explicit "\n" joins (never a string-replace on the real file, never a
// raw multi-line template literal — the tree is CRLF, and a needle written with "\n" would
// silently no-op against CRLF source and leave the self-check vacuous). Each plant asserts
// it DIFFERS from its clean baseline before asserting the detector trips — a plant that did
// not land proves nothing.
