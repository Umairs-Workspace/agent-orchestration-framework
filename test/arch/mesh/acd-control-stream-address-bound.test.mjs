// Fitness: control-stream-server's admission binds to the CONNECTION's remote
// address (never a self-declared header) and the server never binds all
// interfaces (milestone 34 / story 04, ADR-007 / 33-ADR-002 "the fabric IS the
// admission boundary"; review fix P1.6).
//
// Driven over the REAL startControlStreamServer with a real loopback ws socket
// (the mesh-relay-broker-fanout.test.mjs in-process precedent) — no header is
// ever presented; admission succeeds ONLY because the connecting socket's
// request.socket.remoteAddress (127.0.0.1) is joined, via the injected
// peersByAddress roster, to a peer nodeId. A second assertion proves the bound
// address is never "0.0.0.0" (all interfaces) when no explicit bindAddress is
// supplied (the safe loopback default).
