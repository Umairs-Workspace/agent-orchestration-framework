// Fitness function: acd-mesh-partition-write (milestone 22, ADR-002 / fitness #1).
//
// Partition discipline: every mesh record path is built by the SINGLE seam
// (meshDir/nodeRecordPath), keyed by node id; there is NO shared/aggregate file two
// nodes co-write — so git merges are add-only and the m26 <node>/ segment slots into
// the one join site (compose-with-19). Mirrors 19's acd-run-partition-ready
// (stripComments source-analysis + a runtime N-discrete-files check).
