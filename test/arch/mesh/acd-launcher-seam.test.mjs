// Fitness function: acd-launcher-seam (m42 wave (d) leg d1, wave-3 tail part 2 —
// the successor of acd-desktop-verbs-outside-bijection, REWORKED twice as its
// subject migrated). The original gate kept launcher verbs OUT of the registry so
// no bijection probe could hang on a serve; the launcher seam inverts the
// posture: a verb whose real body is a long-lived foreground process now
// REGISTERS, declaring the body as `cli.launch` — and what this gate protects is
// the seam's discipline:
//
//  A. THE SHIMS STAY SHIMS: `repo` and `desktop` dispatch in meshCommand only as
//     no-verb/unknown-verb refusal shims (refusals a route cannot express) and
//     register NO bare `mesh:repo` / `mesh:desktop` id — their inner verbs are
//     the three-word-routed commands (mesh:repo-publish, mesh:desktop-install,
//     mesh:desktop-run).
//  B. THE SEAM SHAPE: every registered command declaring `cli.launch` also keeps
//     a runnable PROBE — a real run() plus the cli.spec/json faces — because the
//     probe IS the verb's --json face. (That the probe returns without blocking
//     is proven behaviourally by the bijection gates' spawn probes.) Armed
//     non-vacuously: mesh:ui and mesh:serve ride the seam today.
//  C. THE PROBE RULE IS FACE POLICY: src/spine/face.mjs consults cli.launch ONLY
//     when --json was not asked for — `--json` can never launch, so a bijection
//     spawn probe can never hang on a serve BY CONSTRUCTION, not per-command
//     care. Self-checked with a synthetic unguarded face body.
