// Security fitness function: acd-unpublished-repo-directive-refused (F3, T3a) — "a
// directive for a repo NOT mesh.repo.published on the worker is refused with a clear
// coded miss (a structured { ok:false, code:"…" } — here, a structured failed
// assignment-status frame carrying a stable code), never an opaque throw or silent
// no-op."
//
// This is EXACTLY the invariant ARCHITECTURE's #7 (acd-assignment-repo-availability-
// loud, worker half) already proves — this file does NOT duplicate that assertion
// body; it enumerates/references that sibling file's registration (the repo's
// "enumerate the re-armed X" house style) and adds the ONE genuinely-additional
// SECURITY-flavoured proof #7 does not itself assert: the code is STABLE/non-empty
// (the ADR-008 loud-miss discipline) and the SAME directive for a published repo is
// accepted (the have/lack CONTRAST, not just the lack branch).
