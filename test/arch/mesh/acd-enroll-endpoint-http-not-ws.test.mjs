// Fitness function: acd-enroll-endpoint-http-not-ws (milestone 24, ADR-002 / structural
// fitness — the architect's). "The enrollment endpoint keeps the ws envelope
// payload-agnostic."
//
//   "Device-code enrollment is an HTTP route on serveRelay's EXISTING http.createServer
//    (03/ADR-001 — ONE server; the enrollment route slots above the terse 426 fallback),
//    NOT a new ws `kind`. The frozen ws { kind, nodeId, signal } envelope (23/ADR-001)
//    stays payload-agnostic: parseEnvelope / the wss message handler branch on NO
//    enrollment `kind` (no `kind === 'enroll'|'join'|'invite'`), so m26 leasing still
//    adds a `kind` with ZERO relay change (the 22/ADR-004 / 23/ADR-001 forward-stable
//    property). The enrollment match/admit logic, when present, lives in the
//    http.createServer request handler, NOT the wss.on('connection') message path."
//
// This preserves the milestone-23 invariant that the relay never parses signal CONTENT.
// An enrollment ws `kind` would make the relay import + branch on an enrollment payload —
// the exact anti-pattern 23/ADR-001's fitness #2 (acd-relay-envelope-neutral) forbids for
// presence, re-applied to enrollment. Enrollment is a discrete request/response (HTTP),
// not an ephemeral broadcast frame (ws).
//
// Source-discipline grep modelled on acd-relay-envelope-neutral (comment-AND-string-
// stripped live code for the kind-branch matcher; the http/ws handler split read
// structurally). Each proof carries an m03 non-vacuous self-check (the detector fires on a
// planted ws enrollment kind, stays quiet on the accepted HTTP-route form).
//
// State: GREEN today (m23's src/mesh/relay.mjs has no enrollment surface at all — the ws
// envelope is neutral, the http handler only 426s), STILL GREEN when story 01 adds the
// HTTP enrollment route (the route is on the http handler, the ws envelope is untouched),
// and RED only if enrollment is ever put on a ws `kind`. That is the correct lifecycle for
// a payload-agnostic-preservation gate: it guards against the WRONG shape, not the absence
// of the right one.
