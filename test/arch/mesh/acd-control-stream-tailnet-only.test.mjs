// ============================ AMENDED 2026-07-27 (the `direct` fabric cutover) =======
// ADR-007 / 33-ADR-002 originally read: "the control-node stream server admits ONLY
// tailnet peers — the FABRIC is the admission boundary, no token/device-code gate
// resurrected from mesh-registry.mjs."
//
// That premise does not survive a fabric with no overlay. On `direct` (mesh-fabric.mjs)
// there IS no peer table to be a member of, so "is this address a fabric peer" cannot
// answer "who is this connection". Identity moves to the ENROLLMENT CREDENTIAL — which
// is strictly stronger per-node than an address (an IP is spoofable on a shared LAN; a
// per-node issued secret verified in constant time against the live revocation list is
// not), and which enrollment already issues on EVERY fabric.
//
// What SURVIVES unchanged, and is still asserted below, is the MODULE BOUNDARY: the
// credential/roster/enrollment surface is heavier than the server's gate warrants, so
// control-stream-server.mjs still must not import it. The resolver is built by
// mesh-launcher.mjs (which already owns config + the workspace handle) and handed down
// through the server's pre-existing injectable `resolveOrigin` seam. The server stays
// generic about WHERE identity comes from; that is why this cutover needed no new seam.
//
// Redaction (ADR-005) is untouched: it still runs BEFORE any streamed field enters the
// global store.
