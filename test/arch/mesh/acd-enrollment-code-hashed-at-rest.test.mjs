// Fitness function: acd-enrollment-code-hashed-at-rest (milestone 24 / story 01
// device-code flow + story 00 group registry / SECURITY.md T3 "code at rest =
// committed to git") — "The pending device code is stored HASHED, never plaintext."
//
//   "The group registry rides the git-of-record `.mesh/` stream (git IS the bus,
//    22/ADR-003) — so a pending invite record is COMMITTED TO GIT and synced to every
//    peer. A plaintext 6-digit code in that record would be pushed to the whole fleet
//    and live forever in git history. Therefore the enrollment authority persists only
//    a HASH of the code (via node:crypto createHash/scrypt/pbkdf2/hkdf — the same
//    node:crypto seam src/node-identity.mjs already uses at line 31), and matches a
//    presented code by hashing it and comparing against the stored hash. The raw code
//    exists ONLY in flight (the operator reads it off `aof mesh invite`, types it into
//    `aof mesh join`); it is NEVER a field on a durable record."
//
// This is the SECURITY.md control for the "code at rest" threat (T3) — grounded in the
// real seam: src/mesh/store.mjs's presenceRecordPath/nodeRecordPath already prove the
// `.mesh/` partition is git-TRACKED (line 15 "git IS the bus"); a pending-invite record
// on that same bus inherits the same commit-and-sync exposure. The invariant this gate
// enforces is that whatever field name the invite record carries for the code
// (`codeHash` / `hash` / `digest`), it is the OUTPUT of a hash, and no bare code field
// (`code` / `deviceCode` / `plaintext`) is written to the durable record.
//
// Source-discipline grep modelled on acd-relay-stateless (fitness #1, milestone 23):
// scans run over comment-stripped source (for import-specifier reads) and comment-AND-
// string-stripped source (for live-code identifier matchers), so a module's DOCUMENTING
// mentions of "plaintext" / "the code" do NOT trip the guards — only real code does.
// Three proofs, each paired with a non-vacuous m03 self-check (the detector demonstrably
// fires on a planted violation AND stays quiet on the accepted form):
//   (a) THE ENROLLMENT SURFACE HASHES: the module(s) that persist the invite record
//       import node:crypto (createHash / scrypt / pbkdf2 / hkdf) — there IS a hash seam
//       through which the code is reduced before it reaches disk.
//   (b) NO PLAINTEXT-CODE FIELD IN A WRITE: no durable write (writeText/writeFile)
//       persists a record object with a bare `code:` / `deviceCode:` / `plaintext:`
//       key — the code is stored under a hash-named field (`codeHash`/`hash`/`digest`),
//       never as the raw value.
//   (c) NO NON-HASH ROUND-TRIP OF THE RAW CODE: the module does not JSON.stringify the
//       raw invite code into the persisted record (the code is hashed BEFORE assembly).
//
// State: RED until the enrollment/registry module lands (story 00/01). readFile rejects
// on an absent module ⇒ the gate fails cleanly (module-not-found) — the RED-until-built
// discipline. The gate scans EVERY src/mesh-*.mjs whose source references the invite /
// enrollment surface, so an unexpected-but-plausible module name (mesh-enrollment.mjs /
// mesh-registry.mjs / mesh-invite.mjs) is still covered — the guard is keyed by the
// PRESENCE of the invite surface, not one hard-coded filename.
