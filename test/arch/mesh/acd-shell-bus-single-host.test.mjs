// Fitness function: acd-shell-bus-single-host (m45 / ADR-005 contract points 3 and 5) —
//
//   "The surface → shell channel has ONE host. `declareShellPresent()` is called exactly
//    once in `ui/src`, by the module that renders the shell root; and no routed surface
//    may import the shell."
//
// EXPECTED GREEN from the moment story 45/03 lands. Unlike this milestone's other four
// ratchets it pins no behaviour that was missing — it pins a property the delivered build
// already has, so that the ONE accident that would silently break it cannot happen.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS — the architect's structural review of 45/03, 2026-08-07. The shell bus
// (`ui/src/app/shell-bus.mjs`) carries a MODULE-SCOPE flag, `shellPresent`, flipped by
// `declareShellPresent()` at `ui/src/app/Shell.tsx`'s module scope — i.e. by IMPORTING the
// shell, not by mounting it. That design was reviewed and ACCEPTED, and the reasoning is
// worth restating because this test exists to protect it rather than to grumble at it:
//
//   - A surface asks `hasShellHost()` while RENDERING its own controls, which happens
//     before any parent effect has run. An effect-time flag would make every surface render
//     its contribution in place on the first pass and then move it — precisely what DESIGN's
//     binding rail 2 ("nothing in the shell moves as you navigate") forbids. Module scope is
//     the only place the answer is available early enough.
//   - The two obvious alternatives are worse HERE, measured rather than assumed: a prop is
//     forbidden by task 00's own scenario ("no surface is passed a route, a shell handle or
//     a mode value it did not receive before"), and a React context is unreachable by
//     `test/support/mini-react.mjs`, which implements the five hooks the production surfaces
//     use and NO context — so a context channel would force a rewrite of the fleet's and the
//     board's existing behavioural suites around a shell they do not mount.
//   - The degraded path is the point, not a fallback: with no shell in the bundle a
//     contribution renders IN PLACE, which is what keeps `withFleetApp` / `withBoardApp`
//     (which mount the surface COMPONENT directly) working with zero harness edits.
//
// THE ONE WAY IT BREAKS, AND IT BREAKS SILENTLY. The flag is write-only and is set by an
// IMPORT. So the day any module under `ui/src/{fleet,board,config}/` imports anything at all
// from `ui/src/app/Shell` — a type, `ShellProps`, a constant — `shellPresent` becomes true
// in that bundle with no shell mounted to receive anything. Every surface then publishes its
// controls to a bus nobody reads and renders NOTHING in place: the fleet's scope control, the
// board's sync button and the board's `serverGone` notice all just vanish. No exception, no
// console line, no failing test — `acd-mesh-ui-scope-visible` drives `<Fleet>` alone and
// stays green, because the source it reads still says `<TopBar>` renders `<ScopeControl>`.
//
// A one-line import causing a control to disappear with every gate green is exactly the
// class of failure a fitness function is for: it is not reachable by review attention, and
// it is trivially greppable. Hence three assertions, all structural, all cheap.
