// Fitness function: acd-presence-aggregates-node-workspaces (milestone 38 / ADR-003) —
// "the presence assembly reads the node-workspaces registry (global_node_workspaces),
// NOT a single launch-cwd workspace; presence is unioned across ALL of a node's
// registered workspaces."
//
// THE BUG (m36 UAT, STATE.md): assembleCurrentPresenceRecord (mesh-launcher.mjs:71)
// reads `listItems(ws.workDir)` for ONE workspace — the daemon's launch cwd — so a tray
// app launched from its install dir reads an empty workspace and is permanently `idle`.
// ADR-003 replaces that single read with a read of `global_node_workspaces WHERE
// node_id = ?` and a union of active runs + live sessions across every workspace.
//
// This is a CORRECTNESS invariant on the launcher's presence assembly. The detector
// forbids the launcher's presence path from resting SOLELY on a single-cwd
// `listItems(ws.workDir)` read — once the aggregation lands, the launcher must consult
// `global_node_workspaces` (directly or via a named aggregation seam that does).
//
// STATE OF BUILD: today the launcher still reads the single cwd (the bug). So this test
// is written to PASS today by pinning the SHAPE of the fix's presence in source, in a
// mode that does not go red before the story lands: it asserts EITHER the aggregation is
// present (global_node_workspaces consulted from the presence path) OR a `todo` marker
// records the pending fix — and it ALWAYS runs the self-check that would catch a
// regression away from the aggregation once it exists. A story that lands the fix
// without wiring the registry read trips the detector.
//
// Proofs:
//  1. The launcher's presence assembly, once it aggregates, references
//     `global_node_workspaces` (the registry table) — never resting on a lone
//     `listItems(ws.workDir)` as its only item source.
//  2. Pending-tolerance: while unbuilt, the single-cwd read is recorded as a KNOWN
//     pending gap (a `todo`-style acknowledgement in ARCHITECTURE ADR-003), not a
//     silent green — the test asserts the ADR names the seam so the fix is not
//     forgotten.
//  Self-check (m03 non-vacuous): a source that aggregates but drops the registry read
//  trips the detector.
