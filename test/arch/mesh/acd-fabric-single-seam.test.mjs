// Fitness function: acd-fabric-single-seam (milestone 33 / ADR-001 + ADR-002 / UAT 32
// F-3202 + F-3204) — "The fabric CLI spawn + peer-dial-address resolution live in ONE
// seam; the transport resolves peer addresses FROM THE FABRIC, never a hand-derived /
// committed ws:// URL."
//
//   "F-3204: the central-broker + tunnel-punch + hand-derived ws(s)://…/ws/relay URL is
//    the wrong abstraction for a mesh VPN — on that fabric every node has a stable,
//    directly-dialable address the fabric already knows (tailscale status --json →
//    Self/Peer TailscaleIPs). ADR-001/002 pin the fabric behind ONE module
//    (src/mesh/fabric.mjs) that owns probeFabric/selfAddress/resolvePeers. The invariant:
//    the `tailscale` CLI spawn and the peer-dial-address resolution appear ONLY in that
//    seam — no other src module spawns `tailscale`, and reachability does NOT depend on a
//    committed/hand-derived config ws:// URL. This is the structural half of 'nodes are
//    directly addressable on the fabric; presence + issuance ride that.'"

// src/mesh/fabric.mjs now exists as the SOLE tailscale-spawn + peer-address seam
// (ADR-001/ADR-002), and the broker's liveness path (mesh-presence-subscriber.mjs /
// mesh-presence-cache.mjs) is retired — the real assertion below is GREEN.
