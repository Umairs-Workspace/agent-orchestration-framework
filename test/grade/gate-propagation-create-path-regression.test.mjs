// test/grade/gate-propagation-create-path-regression.test.mjs — traceability for milestone 43 /
// story 05 (gate-time propagation), task
//   wiki/work/43_milestone_mesh-artifact-authority/stories/05_story_gate-propagation/
//     tasks/03_create-path-and-unavailable-base-regression.feature
//
// The REGRESSION GUARD around the gating change. This story flips a condition that read
// `baseBranch == null && !branchExists && directive.commit != null`, so the two behaviours
// that condition protected are pinned here: (a) the CREATE path still builds a fresh branch
// from exactly the pinned commit, and (b) `assignment-base-commit-unavailable` still fires —
// now at EVERY door — when the pinned commit is unreachable after the one `git fetch origin`
// that `ensureCommitAvailable` performs. It also pins the two m42 invariants the advance
// runs through: ONE derivable branch per item, and the plain `git push origin <branch>`
// still landing the whole line on origin.
//
// THE ONE GENUINELY NEW BEHAVIOUR, flagged rather than smuggled in (the task's own @qa note
// and ADR-010 R5.1): the reuse-door rows of the unavailable-base table are a BEHAVIOUR
// CHANGE. Today a continuing item with an unreachable pinned commit RUNS (the pin is ignored
// at that door); after this story it REFUSES with the existing code. That is ADR-008's
// posture applied consistently — a refine already refused, so this removes an inconsistency
// — but it turns a previously-runnable continue into a coded failure whenever the control's
// checkout has unpushed commits, which is why the refusal message names the cure.
