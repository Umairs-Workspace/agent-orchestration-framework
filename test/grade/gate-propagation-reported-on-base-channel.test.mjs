//   wiki/work/43_milestone_mesh-artifact-authority/stories/05_story_gate-propagation/
//     tasks/02_advance-reported-on-the-worktree-base-channel.feature
//
// The REPORTING half of the advance, which is contractual and not cosmetic: every dispatch
// that reaches the reuse door emits ONE line on the SAME log channel that already carries
// `worker-worktree-base`, carrying the outcome (`already-current` / `fast-forwarded` /
// `merged` / the refusal code) and BOTH COMMITS — so "which base did it actually run on"
// stays one `aof mesh logs --node <id>` read rather than an SSH inspection of a worker's
// checkout.
//
// Every entry is captured through the handler's injected `onLog` seam — the SAME seam
// `worker-worktree-base` is emitted through, so channel identity is itself observable — and
// the two hashes in each entry are compared against real `git rev-parse` output.
//
// The LAUNCHER's wiring is what makes "the same channel" load-bearing rather than a naming
// convention: mesh-launcher.mjs forwards `{ code, level, message }` into `emitWarning` and
// drops every other key, so the two commits must be IN the rendered line to survive to
// `aof mesh logs`. That is why the assertions below parse the message rather than reading a
// structured field the wire would never carry.
