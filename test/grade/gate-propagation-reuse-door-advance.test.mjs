//     tasks/00_reuse-door-advances-to-the-pinned-base.feature
//
// THE BUG THIS STORY FIXES, asserted end-to-end: the pin check used to be gated
// `baseBranch == null && !branchExists && directive.commit != null`, so a CONTINUING item —
// which by definition takes the reuse door — never saw the control's edit. Every scenario
// here drives the REAL `createMeshWorkerExecutionHandler` against a REAL local git fixture
// repo through a real `git` binary (no mocked git, no network), and every Then is read back
// from git state in the worker's checkout / the materialized worktree, exactly as the task's
// LITMUS requires — `git merge-base --is-ancestor`, `git rev-parse <branch>^1/^2`,
// `git rev-list --count`, `git cat-file -e <branch>:<path>` — plus the advance's own
// REPORTED outcome on the log channel (task 02 pins the rendering).
//
// NOT ASSERTED HERE: that no history-rewriting git operation exists on this path. That is an
// ABSENCE, and it lives in test/arch/grade/acd-gate-propagation-never-discards.test.mjs. What this
// file asserts is its OBSERVABLE consequence, per case: every commit the worker had already
// made is still reachable from the branch afterwards.
