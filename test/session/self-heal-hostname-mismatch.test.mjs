// Traceability wiring for milestone 33 / story 00 — per-install node identity.
//
// Covers EVERY @executable scenario in tasks/03_self-heal-hostname-mismatch.feature,
// exercising src/work.mjs's healIdentitySidecar (the self-heal step factored out of
// loadWorkspace's own heal-site call — see work.mjs's header comment) IN-PROCESS with
// an injected sidecar object + current hostname (+ an optional takenIds roster for
// the collision-preserving scenario), plus a real temp sidecar file for the
// rewrite/byte-unchanged assertions. One test object per @executable scenario
// (Scenario-Outline rows folded into one entry iterating the rows), each name tracing
// to feature + scenario. node:assert/strict.
//
//   03_self-heal-hostname-mismatch.feature — a sidecar whose nodeId was hostname-
//     derived but whose recorded hostname no longer matches this machine's current
//     hostname re-derives from the CURRENT hostname and rewrites the sidecar; an
//     operator-pinned id is honoured and never auto-healed; the copied-sidecar F-3203
//     symptom self-corrects; the heal re-derives with the sidecar's OWN salt
//     (preserving a collision suffix); the heal is self-terminating (a second load on
//     the now-correct host is a keep, not a repeated rewrite).
