// Traceability wiring for milestone 18 / story 01, task 02 —
// tasks/02_multiboard-sidecar-coexistence.feature (@executable, every scenario). One
// test object per @executable scenario; ADR-005/006.
//
//   readMapping(projectRoot, dataSourceId)  → { dataSourceId, entries }  (THAT board's bucket; empty on absent — never throws)
//   resolvePageId(mapping, aofRef)          → pageId | null
//   recordPageId(projectRoot, dataSourceId, aofRef, pageId, meta) → merge into the bucket, leaving others untouched
//
// Drives the v2 per-data-source-bucket store against a temp projectRoot (no live
// Notion). Each scenario uses a fresh temp root (the feature Background: "a project with
// a git-ignored .aof/notion.work-map.json sidecar"). A binding under board A and a
// binding under board B coexist; recording B leaves A's bucket untouched; a ref resolves
// ONLY under its own data-source; a legacy v1 file migrates on first read; the cross-board
// guard applies to the migration path; the first record after a v1 read rewrites it v2
// non-lossily; an absent file is an empty mapping.
