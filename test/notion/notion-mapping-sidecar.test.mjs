// Traceability wiring for milestone 17 / story 00 — the `.aof/` mapping sidecar
// (ADR-001). One test object per @executable scenario of
// `02_mapping-sidecar-roundtrip.feature`.
//
//   readMapping(projectRoot, dataSourceId) → { entries }   (empty on absent file — NEVER throws)
//   resolvePageId(mapping, aofRef)         → pageId | null  (HIT → pageId; MISS → null)
//   recordPageId(projectRoot, dataSourceId, aofRef, pageId, meta) → persist the binding back
//
// Drives the store against a temp projectRoot with no live Notion — the @executable
// lane. Each scenario uses a fresh temp project root (the feature Background: "an
// empty temp project root with no .aof/notion.work-map.json sidecar").
