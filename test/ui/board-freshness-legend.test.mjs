// Traceability wiring for milestone 43 / story 04 / task 07 —
// tasks/07_freshness-legend-documents-the-window.feature (@executable).
//
// A new read-only vocabulary that is not in the legend is a vocabulary the
// operator must guess. Both legends gain a Freshness block painting the REAL
// badge beside its label, and the block states the window from the ONE number
// that arrives on the wire — degrading to WORDS, never to a guessed number, when
// the wire does not carry it.
//
// WHY THE DEGRADE MATTERS MORE THAN IT LOOKS. The threshold is configured ONCE in
// `src/` and travels on the response; `ui/` carries no default and no literal
// (that half is a structural ABSENCE and is asserted by
// `acd-cache-staleness-single-predicate`, not restated here). The consequence is
// that when the wire does not carry the number the UI genuinely does not know it
// — and the only honest legend row is one that names the window without
// quantifying it. A "5 minutes" fallback baked into the legend would be a SECOND
// threshold by another route: it would keep reading "5 minutes" long after an
// operator configured 30, and the operator would have no way to notice.
//
// THE LEGEND MUST MIRROR THE PAINTED RAMP 1:1 — the rule the board legend's own
// comment already states, and the reason m35's assignment block paints real chips
// rather than drawings. So the swatch is asserted to be the SAME component, with
// the SAME token set, as the badge the surface paints on a real stale item.
//
// Driven off the RENDERED TREES of the REAL <Board/> and the REAL <Fleet/>,
// mounted against their REAL faces. The window arrives by being CONFIGURED in the
// workspace's own `.aof/aof.config.json` and resolved by the face's own resolver
// — never injected into a response.
