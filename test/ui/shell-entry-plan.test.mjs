// Traceability wiring for milestone 45 / story 03, task 00 —
// `stories/03_story_app-shell-and-entry/tasks/00_entry-selects-a-surface.feature` (@executable).
//
// THE CHANNEL. The feature's own LITMUS: "every Then is a returned VALUE from a framework-free
// `.mjs` module that node:test loads with no bundler, no DOM and no browser". That module is
// `ui/src/app/entry.mjs` — the entry's decision, extracted exactly as the feature's FEASIBILITY
// note requires ("the steps read a plan of the shape `{ replace: {pathname,search,hash}|null,
// surface }` derived from the incoming URL parts"). `ui/src/main.tsx` does nothing with the
// plan but call `history.replaceState` when `replace` is non-null and hand `surface` to the
// shell, so nothing about the decision is left where a test cannot reach it.
//
// The two PLACEMENT invariants the feature explicitly does NOT assert here — "the entry imports
// surfaces and defines none", "there is exactly ONE route table and the render root reaches it"
// — belong to test/arch/ui/acd-ui-single-route-table.test.mjs, and the route module's own purity
// and idempotence belong to acd-route-logic-framework-free. What is BEHAVIOURAL, and is the
// whole of this task, is the WIRING those two cannot see.
