// Traceability wiring for milestone 43 / story 04 / task 03 —
// tasks/03_freshness-ramp-and-stale-badge.feature (@executable).
//
// DRIVEN TWO WAYS, exactly as the task's LITMUS requires:
//   1. the PURE ramp module (ui/src/board/freshness.mjs) for its return value
//      over injected inputs — the state, both renderings, the tooltip sentence;
//   2. the REAL, UNMODIFIED production <Board/> tree, mounted headlessly against
//      a REAL board face (src/board-ui.mjs) over an isolated global store, on a
//      CONTROLLABLE clock that owns `Date.now()`. Element text, `className`
//      tokens, attributes, sibling ORDER and THE COUNT OF FETCHES THE APP MADE
//      are all read off that rendered tree and the app's own traffic. No source
//      read anywhere in this file.
//
// WHY BOTH, AND WHY THE SECOND ONE MATTERS MORE. The F-38.06e lesson: "a state
// satisfied by calling the reducer directly proved nothing, because production
// could never drive it." A ramp module that emits `◌ stale · 12m ago` proves
// nothing about whether the board paints it, where it paints it, or whether it
// paints it WITHOUT a network round trip — which is the whole of AC 8.
//
// THE ZERO-NETWORK CLAUSE IS THE LOAD-BEARING ONE. The board only re-polls its
// list while something is EXECUTING, so a settled stale item — the common case,
// since a row is stale precisely because its owner stopped reporting — would
// never grow a badge if the crossing were fetch-driven. Counting the app's own
// requests across the crossing is what distinguishes "computed off the clock"
// from "computed off a fetch that happened to land".
//
// PIXEL facts (does the chip's right edge really not move; does the ramp read as
// degraded rather than broken; does the pinned form actually fit the 360px fleet
// card) are NOT claimed here — they are task 09's `@uat` render verdict, exactly
// as m38's DG-13 lanes split.
//
// ── TWO THINGS THIS FILE RECORDS RATHER THAN PAPERS OVER ────────────────────
//
// DEV-1 (raised, and now RESOLVED IN THE CONTRACT). The first Examples row of
// the three-states outline used to state `4 seconds before now` → `synced 4s
// ago`. The same scenario's own note says those words are the product's ONE
// `relativeTime` formatter's words, "not this ramp's" — and that formatter
// renders any span under five seconds as `just now` (runs.mjs), so the two could
// not both hold. The PO corrected the CELL rather than the code (2026-08-03):
// the row now reads `10 seconds before now` → `synced 10s ago`, which keeps the
// row's subject (a seconds-grain fresh age) with no second time vocabulary. This
// lane follows the corrected cell.
//
// DEV-2 (raised as blocked; now CLOSED on both halves, and the second half was
// closed by the CONTRACT moving rather than by the code). The fourth Examples row
// of the forms outline used to render the MINIMAL form on the FLEET milestone
// card at its narrowest.
//   - The WIRE half is CLOSED: `/api/mesh/status` now carries the same two
//     per-row keys and the same `stalenessSeconds` as the board's envelope, so a
//     fleet card CAN be fed a stale row and the badge mounts for real. Task 04's
//     lane does exactly that against the real fleet face.
//   - The FORM-SELECTION half was raised as an unassertable PIXEL fact ("which of
//     the three forms a 360px card picks is a width decision; the rendered
//     element tree has no width"). DESIGN WITHDREW the viewport-keyed ladder
//     outright on 2026-08-03, because it was keyed to the wrong variable: the
//     fleet grid is `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(320px, 1fr))`, so it adds COLUMNS
//     rather than width and the card sits in a ~300–370px band at EVERY
//     breakpoint — it is NARROWER at 2560 than at 1280. The binding rule is now
//     "the form is chosen by the SURFACE, not by the viewport", and the PO
//     corrected the cell to `short` at all widths. That makes the row ASSERTABLE
//     here, and the forms lane below now mounts the real <Fleet/> and reads it —
//     the flag's own condition ("if the yield is wanted as behaviour") answered
//     by removing the yield rather than by inventing a budget number.
// The ramp's minimal RENDERING is asserted here and its a11y contract in task 08;
// `minimal` is RESERVED with no painter in this milestone.
