// Traceability wiring for milestone 43 / story 04 / task 04 —
// tasks/04_provenance-line-and-node-attribution.feature (@executable).
//
// THE RULE BEING ENCODED, in one sentence: the cache is now the read surface, so
// every fact on the board is a copy of something a machine said at some instant —
// and the reader must always be able to see WHOSE and WHEN, without asking.
// Attribution used to be an EXECUTION detail (the provenance box rendered only
// when `item.execution` existed); this milestone makes it a first-class fact of
// the item, which is why the SETTLED and NEVER-EXECUTED cases are the ones that
// prove the change — a settled item is exactly the item most likely to be old.
//
// DRIVEN THE WAY THE TASK'S LITMUS REQUIRES: every Then below is read off the
// RENDERED ELEMENT TREE of the REAL, UNMODIFIED production <Board/> (and the real
// <Fleet/>), mounted headlessly against the REAL faces over an isolated global
// store, on a controllable clock. The presence, ORDER and TEXT of the provenance
// lines, and the ABSENCE of the retired copy, are all element facts. No source
// read anywhere in this file.
//
// PRODUCER-FED THROUGHOUT. A lane says "umamis-mac-mini reported this workspace
// twelve minutes ago" by making the REAL publisher write exactly that into the
// REAL store; "the mesh dispatched this item" by minting a REAL assignment record
// through the production assembler + writer; and "the cache holds this doc" by
// writing it through the REAL content upsert. The face then reads all of it back
// through the production mappers. A green lane therefore means the store recorded
// it, the mapper mapped it and the route served it.
//
// ── BOTH SIDES OF THE "IS THIS ROW MINE" FORK ARE COVERED (43/ADR-015 F5) ────
//
// Every provenance and resync lane in this story states a REMOTE reporter
// (`umamis-mac-mini`), which left the whole suite blind to the case where the
// reporter is THIS node — the COMMON deployment, not the exotic one, and the case
// in which the panel had silently retired its m03 empty states. The last lane in
// this file is the fork read from both sides in one place. The reusable half of
// the lesson: a surface whose behaviour forks on "is this row mine" needs at least
// one lane on each side of that fork.
//
// ── TWO THINGS THIS FILE FLAGS RATHER THAN PAPERS OVER ──────────────────────
//
// (DEV-3 was here and is CLOSED, 2026-08-03. It flagged the two `(this node)`
// Examples cells as a contract with no producer: the clause needs the board to
// know WHICH NODE IT IS RUNNING ON, and `/api/work/list`'s envelope carried only
// `{ items, stalenessSeconds }`. The face now states `nodeId` on that envelope —
// the one-key change of exactly the shape ADR-010 R4.1 made for the window — so
// both cells are asserted END TO END below, through the real face and the real
// mappers, like every other Then in this file.)
//
// DEV-6 (RAISED — the DEV-1 defect class, at a second address). The headline
// outline's `running on a worker` row states `synced 4s ago`. The product has ONE
// relative-time formatter (`relativeTime`, runs.mjs) and it renders any span
// under five seconds as `just now`, so `4s ago` is a string this ramp cannot
// produce without growing a second time vocabulary — which is the very thing
// DESIGN forbids. This is the SAME cell defect the PO already corrected in task
// 03 (`4 seconds` → `10 seconds`). The lane honours the RULE and states the row's
// actual subject — a fresh, seconds-grain age on an EXECUTING item, beside an
// unchanged line 1 — at `10s`. The cell, not the code, is what needs the edit.
//
// DEV-5 (DEVIATION, stated). The per-doc lanes use the milestone's VERIFICATION
// and RETROSPECTIVE tabs where the scenarios name SPEC. The reason is structural
// and the task file already names it: `work:doc` prefers LOCAL DISK and only
// falls through to the cached artifact on ENOENT, and "serving the doc body out
// of the cache is story 06's job". A milestone's own `SPEC.md` must exist on disk
// for the milestone to be LISTED at all, so its SPEC tab can never reach the
// cache today — whereas VERIFICATION is the doc most likely to be authored on a
// WORKER (that is where `aof:verify` runs) and absent from the control checkout,
// which makes it the truest subject this milestone has. Every clause of both
// scenarios — the line's TEXT, its position as the region's FIRST child, the
// markdown following it, no second badge, no second Resync, the row and the doc
// judged SEPARATELY, and the reworded placeholder's exact sentence shape and
// dashed treatment — is asserted verbatim; only the doc's NAME differs.
