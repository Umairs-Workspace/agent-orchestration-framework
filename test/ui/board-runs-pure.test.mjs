// Traceability wiring for milestone 21 — the PURE run-observability helpers
// (ui/src/board/runs.mjs). Covers every HEADLESS @executable scenario across the
// two stories' task features, imported the same way the React DetailPanel imports
// the module (Node ≥20, no type-stripping — the action.mjs / dock-state.mjs
// convention), so the formatter / selection / chip ramp / verb / predicate are
// asserted with no browser. node:assert/strict.
//
//   story 00 / 00_runs-render        — a run's createdAt renders as a relative timestamp
//   story 00 / 01_current-run        — current-run selection + the run-state chip ramp
//   story 00 / 02_runs-poll-refresh  — the "refreshed Ns ago" freshness label
//   story 01 / 00_rerun-launches     — the rerun resolves to a fresh work:run-start verb
//   story 01 / 01_rerun-disabled     — the rerun is disabled exactly when a run is in flight
