// Traceability wiring for milestone 45 / story 01 (the route model) — ui/src/app/routes.mjs,
// the ONE pure route table and the ONE legacy `?mode=` translation.
//
// THE CHANNEL. This module is PURE and has NO CLI surface, so the black-box channel every
// scenario below is confirmed through is `node:test` importing the module directly and
// asserting on RETURNED VALUES — no bundler, no DOM, no React harness (this repo has none
// at all). That is the house pattern: test/ui/fleet-scope.test.mjs does exactly this for
// ui/src/fleet/scope.mjs. Nothing here reads the module's source; the two PLACEMENT
// invariants (React-free/DOM-free, and "names no query key but `mode`") are owned by
// test/arch/command/acd-route-logic-framework-free.test.mjs, and "the entry applies the translation
// exactly once" is story 45/03's, owned by acd-ui-single-route-table.
//
//   tasks/00_route-table.feature (@executable) — six scenarios:
//     - each of the four paths resolves to exactly one named surface;
//     - an unknown path resolves to the shell's ONE 404 surface, and the address is not
//       rewritten (the redirect function declines);
//     - a single trailing slash is matched IN PLACE, with no rewrite;
//     - nothing under the bundle's own asset directory is a route at all;
//     - a shapeless or hostile pathname resolves to not-found and never throws (including
//       the two host-swap shapes a URL-normalising table would silently accept);
//     - the table is total, deterministic and single-valued — frozen against caller
//       mutation, and blind to any second argument (ADR-002's ORIGIN-BLIND rule).
//   tasks/01_legacy-mode-redirect.feature (@executable) — seven scenarios:
//     - every `?mode=` URL the product has ever advertised maps onto its path;
//     - `mode` is the only parameter removed, including the shapes a regex strip eats;
//     - a URL that already carries a path is returned unchanged (the PATH wins);
//     - applying the rewrite to its own output is a no-op — `replaceState` cannot loop;
//     - a bare `/` carrying no `mode` is not rewritten;
//     - a shapeless input is answered, never thrown at;
//     - the parts object handed in is never mutated, and the answer is a NEW object.
//   tasks/02_query-and-fragment-passthrough.feature (@executable) — seven scenarios:
//     - `?scope=` survives a redirect intact, unvalidated and undefaulted by the router;
//     - a parameter the router has never heard of survives (repeated keys, value-less keys);
//     - parameter ORDER survives from every position `mode` can occupy;
//     - every surviving value reads back as the same text (the satisfiable reading of
//       "unmangled" — decodes identically, in order, same entry count; NOT byte-identical,
//       which the mandated copy-and-delete mechanism cannot deliver: F-45-01-B);
//     - the board drill-in still lands on item 18 after the rewrite;
//     - the `#ref` fragment survives whatever it carries, and is never interpreted;
//     - a canonical URL carrying every exotic parameter at once is not touched.
//
// Feature 00's Background line about the built bundle emitting `ui/dist/assets/index-*.js`
// is a GIVEN about vite's output, not a Then: it is what makes `/assets` unroutable, and it
// is asserted through behaviour (the asset-directory scenario) rather than by reading a
// build artefact that a clean checkout has not produced yet.
