// test/ui/board-mesh-execution.test.mjs — VERIFICATION (board mesh-execution overlay,
// live two-machine soak 2026-07-25).
//
// THE DEFECT (operator-reported): the board showed milestone 18 as "not started" while a
// WORKER node was executing it, and kept saying so after it finished. The board reads the
// CONTROL node's own local record-doc frontmatter, which genuinely says `not-started` —
// the work happened on another machine, on a mesh branch this checkout does not have. The
// overlay answers the operator's three steps: (1) is it executing, (2) show THAT, (3) else
// fall back to local.
