// Traceability wiring for milestone 45 / story 03, task 01 —
// `stories/03_story_app-shell-and-entry/tasks/01_shell-regions.feature` (@executable).
//
// THE CHANNEL. The feature's LITMUS: "every Then is a returned VALUE from
// `ui/src/app/shell-layout.mjs` — the framework-free module ADR-005 names, loaded by node:test
// with no bundler and no DOM. The shell's LAYOUT is therefore tested as a MODEL." Every lane
// below reads that model.
//
// THREE CLAUSES ARE ABOUT THE DOCUMENT, NOT THE MODEL, and they are driven through the REAL
// rendered tree instead (test/support/shell-app-harness.mjs, and the fleet's and board's own
// harnesses): that exactly one `banner` and one `<main>` SURVIVE the absorption of the
// surfaces' own bars, that the skip link is the FIRST focusable element, and that no routed
// surface paints a brand mark or a wordmark of its own. A model cannot see any of those, and
// they are precisely what the absorption could regress.
//
// WHAT STAYS IN TASK 04's @uat RENDER VERDICT: whether 88px of chrome really leaves 432px in
// the Rust app's window, whether the page double-scrolls, whether the rail really pushes rather
// than overlays, whether the bar survives the 390 squeeze without a horizontal scrollbar. Those
// are pixel facts judged by a person over renders — the m43 split, structural half here.
