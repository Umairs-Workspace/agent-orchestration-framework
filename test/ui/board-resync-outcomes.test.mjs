// Traceability wiring for milestone 43 / story 04 / task 06 —
// tasks/06_resync-owner-unreachable.feature (@executable).
//
// The offline owner is the INTERESTING case, and it is DESIGNED rather than left
// as an error path: the item is stale precisely BECAUSE its owner stopped
// reporting, so "ask the owner for a fresh push" can very plausibly get no
// answer. DESIGN pinned seven states; this file is that table, plus the four
// rules that decide it.
//
// ── THE STATE → CODE MAPPING, VERIFIED AGAINST THE TRANSPORT ON DISK ────────
// DESIGN names seven UI states; `src/mesh/resync.mjs` + `src/commands/resync.mjs`
// produce SIX coded outcomes, all at HTTP 200. The rest are CLIENT LEGS, and that
// split is the design's own — the button reports the CALL, so only the call's
// outcomes can come from the wire:
//
//   idle              — no call yet.                          (no producer needed)
//   in-flight         — the POST is outstanding.              (client: the awaited call)
//   accepted          — `resync-requested` (ok:true)          → muted acknowledgement
//   landed            — a fresher `syncedAt` on the LIST.     (not a resync outcome at all —
//                       the badge clearing IS the proof, which is the whole design)
//   no answer         — `resync-pending` (the command's own request-leg bound)
//                       OR the CLIENT's watch window elapsing with no fresher copy
//   owner unreachable — `resync-owner-not-connected` / `resync-owner-unreachable`
//   refused           — `resync-no-owner`, the ONLY rejection → the ONLY destructive rung
//
// …plus ONE state DESIGN did not name and 43/ADR-014/E2 added:
//
//   the owner is THIS node — `resync-owner-is-self` → MUTED, its own phase.
//       It used to answer `resync-owner-not-connected`, which was wrong in the
//       exact case DESIGN cares about: a control-authored row goes stale
//       precisely when the control's own publish tick stops, and "not connected"
//       named a connectivity fact that was never tested. No call is made, so no
//       connectivity claim can honestly be reported — and, for the same reason,
//       it writes NO persistent `· owner unreachable` clause to the line.
//
// EVERY DESIGN STATE HAS A PRODUCER, AND EVERY PRODUCER HAS A STATE. Nothing is
// invented and nothing is orphaned. The one substantive shape this file records:
// `no answer` is reachable by TWO distinct routes (a server-side request-leg
// bound and a client-side watch window), and DESIGN is right that they must read
// the same to the operator — both are "the world did not answer", both muted,
// both retryable.
//
// ── THE FOUR RULES, AND WHAT EACH ONE FORBIDS ───────────────────────────────
//  1. MUTED = the world did not answer. DESTRUCTIVE = the request was rejected.
//     An unreachable owner cost us NOTHING — the cached copy is intact and is
//     still the only readable one — so reddening it would over-alarm precisely
//     the condition this milestone exists to normalise.
//  2. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS DECAY; FACTS PERSIST. `Requested` decays after one poll
//     interval. `owner <node> unreachable` is a statement about the WORLD and
//     stays on the line until a fresher copy lands or a later attempt supersedes it.
//  3. NEVER PRE-DISABLED ON PRESENCE. Attempt, then report.
//  4. THE CACHED COPY IS NEVER HIDDEN BY A FAILURE.
//
// PRODUCER-FED, through the REAL control-daemon drain. The lane supplies only the
// FABRIC — which node holds a connected admitted socket, and whether a dispatch
// onto it completes — and the REAL tick turns that into the REAL coded outcome
// the REAL command reports. `connected: [owner] + deliver:true` → accepted;
// `connected: []` → owner-not-connected; `deliver:false` → owner-unreachable; a
// row with no recorded author → the coded refusal. No response is painted on.
