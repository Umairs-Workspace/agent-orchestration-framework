// Traceability wiring for milestone 38 / story 04 / task 03 —
// tasks/03_assign-affordance-renders.feature (@executable).
//
// ARCHITECTURE 38/ADR-008 — "a component must be tested through the component
// PRODUCTION RENDERS / INVOKES … establish, from the producer, WHICH component
// the real payload mounts." This repo ships no React test harness: the
// render-logic under test lives in the pure fleet helpers
// (ui/src/fleet/scope.mjs's `assignableNodeOptions` + assignments.mjs's
// `assignmentChip`) — the SAME helpers the production Fleet.tsx card renders
// the picker + chip from (ui/src/fleet/Fleet.tsx's GlobalMilestoneCard).
//
// @executable proves the DATA is PRODUCER-FED, not fixture-shaped: the roster
// the picker offers is derived from the REAL GET /api/mesh/status payload
// (empty / one / live+stale), and the chip is derived from a REAL minted
// record (through the REAL POST /api/mesh/assign route, task 00) — never a
// hand-built node list nor a hand-built assignment object (STATE.md F1/F4/F9).
//
// Driven over withPublishedAssignFixture (test/support/mesh-ui-assign-fixture.mjs)
// — a REAL end-to-end publish (workspace snapshot + node registry), so a node is
// VISIBLE through the REAL registry read, not just eligible on the write side.

  // ══ Scenario: the target the row NAMES is the target the POST carries ══
  //
  // REVIEW FIX QA-a (2026-07-24) — F21's defect class, relocated to the NODE
  // axis, reproduced end-to-end in Chromium by QA and confirmed at source. The
  // fleet face is a LONG-LIVED monitor that re-polls every POLL_MS, so the
  // roster under a mounted picker changes while the row sits there. Remembered
  // selection alone went stale: the <select>'s DOM value coerced to the first
  // surviving option while React state kept the DEPARTED id, so the row
  // displayed one target and POSTed another — and `Sent` then sat beside the
  // wrong name.
  //
  // F21's lesson, generalised: a seam whose defect is a WRONG TARGET must be
  // exercised with ≥2 candidates where the chosen one can STOP BEING VALID. The
  // roster change is the codebase's own documented producer, not an invented
  // one: queryGlobalRegistry drops a `global_nodes` row whose descriptor file no
  // longer resolves, while assignWork's node-known gate reads `global_nodes`
  // DIRECTLY — so a node can leave the picker and remain assign-eligible, which
  // is exactly what makes the mis-dispatch SILENT rather than refused.
