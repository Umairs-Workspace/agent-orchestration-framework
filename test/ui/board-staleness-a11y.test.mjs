// Traceability wiring for milestone 43 / story 04 / task 08 —
// tasks/08_staleness-a11y-contract.feature (@executable).
//
// The freshness ramp's PROGRAMMATIC accessibility contract: the badge never
// carries its meaning in colour alone, a glyph-only badge has an accessible name,
// Resync NAMES ITS OBJECT, its busy state is visible AND programmatic, outcomes
// are announced through a permanently-present polite live region, and the
// threshold crossing is deliberately NOT announced.
//
// THE A11Y LANE IS OFF IN THIS REPO, AND THAT IS THE DECISION, NOT AN OVERSIGHT.
// Per 07/ADR-004 the automated lane is opt-in via `work.tags.domains` containing
// `"a11y"`; `.aof/aof.config.json` lists no such domain. So there is NO
// axe-core-via-Playwright run for this story and NO a11y finding will be logged
// from one. NOTHING BELOW IS AN AXE ASSERTION: these are ordinary DOM/attribute
// assertions off the rendered tree, which is a behavioural check QA has always
// owned. The PERCEPTUAL half — does the ramp actually read as degraded, does the
// word survive a greyscale render, is the hit target really 24 CSS px — cannot be
// settled from an element tree and is task 09's `@uat` judgement over a real
// browser render.
//
// THE ONE FAILURE THIS FILE EXISTS TO PREVENT. A ramp whose entire purpose is a
// THRESHOLD is the easiest kind to build colour-only: grey it and move on. The
// rule is the m03/m25 one — colour and label always travel together — and here
// the WORD `stale` is what carries the meaning, with the dashed border explicitly
// DECORATIVE (it would not clear the 3:1 non-text contrast bar, and no meaning
// may depend on it).
