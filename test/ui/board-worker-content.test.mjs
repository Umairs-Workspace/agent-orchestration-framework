// schema v5 (TECH_DEBT item 6 — finish the board bridge): the board's drill-downs
// answer from the worker-streamed projection when the LOCAL checkout cannot.
//
// THE DEFECT (measured live, 2026-07-26): the worker→control stream bridged an
// item's ROWS, so the board correctly listed a milestone's seven streamed stories —
// then every drill-down read the control node's local disk and dead-ended:
//   - clicking a streamed story → `Could not load STORY: No item resolves to ref "18/03"`
//   - the RUNS tab read the local runs/ dir → "No runs yet", for an item RUNNING remotely
// The board asserted a state it could not evidence. These tests pin the fix at the
// command layer (work:doc / work:run-status — every face gains the fallback):
//   - a ref the local checkout has never seen answers from the streamed projection,
//     marked fromWorker + reportedBy (whose view this is)
//   - a locally-resolved item whose doc file is absent answers from the projection
//   - the local disk WINS whenever it can answer (local-first, like the row merge)
//   - nothing streamed → behaviour is byte-identical to before (404 / absent / [])
