// Traceability wiring for milestone 45 / story 03, task 05 —
// `stories/03_story_app-shell-and-entry/tasks/05_surface-crash-degrades-in-shell.feature`
// (@executable @bug @finding-F-45-M-1).
//
// THE DEFECT THIS SUITE EXISTS FOR, measured at `aof:verify 45` in a real browser against the
// live fleet daemon: `/config` on the fleet origin rendered a TOTALLY BLANK page. `<App>`
// fetches `/api/config`; the fleet origin is the one origin that does not serve it, so the
// 404's coded envelope was stored AS the config payload, `payload.resources` was `undefined`,
// and a `useMemo` called `.filter` on it. With no boundary above the mounted surface React
// unmounted the WHOLE tree — the shell, the top bar, the nav and the way back went with it.
// Fourteen of fifteen measured (origin × path) cells rendered the shell; that one did not, and
// it was one click from the fleet's own navigation.
//
// TWO HALVES, and they are different claims:
//   1. THE SURFACE degrades through its OWN error state — `<App>` now checks `response.ok`
//      before believing a body, which is what every other fetch in that file already did.
//      That is the DESIGNED path and it is what `Shell.tsx`'s `resolvable` note promises.
//   2. THE SHELL contains a surface that throws anyway — the safety net, so 47's and 49's new
//      surfaces inherit the rule instead of rediscovering it. This is the half that needed a
//      class component, because `getDerivedStateFromError` has no hook form.
//
// WHAT MADE THIS DRIVABLE AT ALL. `test/support/mini-react.mjs` grew class-component + error
// boundary support for this suite (additive; every function component path is untouched).
// Before that a boundary was undrivable headlessly, which is exactly why the contract in
// `Shell.tsx:91-94` could sit there reviewed, believed and false for one surface in four.
//
// THE NON-VACUITY GATE IS THE LAST LANE and it is not decorative: it asserts that the
// harness's throwing surface REALLY throws when the boundary is not there, so a green run
// cannot mean "nothing was ever thrown".
