// test/ui/fleet-terminal-view-producer-fed.test.mjs — QA-authored behavioural coverage
// for milestone 38 / story 06 / task 04 (BLOCKER F-38.06c), added at the task-04
// behavioural review (2026-07-23). Carries findings **F-38.06d** and **F-38.06e**.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Task 04's own traceability module
// (test/ui/fleet-terminal-view-surface.test.mjs) proves each LINK of the three-link
// chain against a payload the TEST chooses:
//   - PERSIST is fed `buildAssignmentStatusFrame(..., { sessionId: "sess-1" })` —
//     the real frame BUILDER, but with the TEST deciding that a session id rides a
//     frame at all, and when,
//   - SURFACE is fed the row PERSIST wrote,
//   - RENDER is fed the row SURFACE projected,
//   - the STATE RAMP is fed by calling `terminalViewOnBytes/onClose/onError`
//     directly — a hand-driven transition, never one a real stream caused.
// Nothing in that module asks the ACTUAL PRODUCERS — `createMeshWorkerExecutionHandler`
// (which decides WHEN a captured session id rides a status frame) and the
// bridge/mirror/route (which decides what a browser socket ever OBSERVES) — whether
// the join key and the state ramp hold at the moment the operator needs them.
//
// That is this milestone's own defect class (ADR-008) at the FOURTH link: a
// component exercised against a fixture shaped to its own convenience, never
// against its real producer's SEQUENCE.
//
// PRODUCER-FED, END TO END, HEADLESS. These lanes wire, in process:
//   the REAL createMeshWorkerExecutionHandler (real worktree, real run-store, real
//   driveInteractiveClaudeSession over the house node-pty double)
//     -> the REAL buildAssignmentStatusFrame (worker-stream-client.mjs — exactly
//        what sendAssignmentStatus does to its arguments)
//     -> the REAL applyStreamFrame (control-stream-server.mjs) over a REAL store
//     -> the REAL queryGlobalMeshStatus shaping (/api/mesh/status)
//     -> the REAL resolveTerminalStream + view-state ramp the browser imports,
//   and, for the stream half, the REAL onOutputChunk bridge -> the REAL
//   buildTerminalFrameEnvelope -> the REAL mirror -> the REAL serveMeshUi
//   /ws/terminal-view route -> a REAL browser socket.
// No hand-built frame, no hand-built row, no hand-driven state transition, no
// hand-picked moment. The ONLY doubles are the house leaf seams every story-05/06
// test already uses (fake `which`, fake node-pty, injected transcript watch,
// scripted push exec) — and the transcript watch is injected to resolve PROMPTLY,
// i.e. the MOST FAVOURABLE case for the feature (a real watch resolves later, never
// earlier).
//
// REGISTERED in scripts/test.mjs (2026-07-23). QA authored these UNREGISTERED
// because two lanes were RED against the build under review and QA does not break
// the suite; both findings are now fixed (F-38.06d — the mid-run live report; and
// F-38.06e — the end-of-stream producer, which the fourth lane below extends to the
// `needs-input` outcome), so the whole module is a standing gate.
