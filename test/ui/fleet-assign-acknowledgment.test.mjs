// Traceability wiring for milestone 38 / story 04 / task 06 —
// tasks/06_assign-acknowledges-on-success.feature (@executable).
//
// F22, observed LIVE at the 2026-07-24 two-machine soak: a `200 ok` produced no
// transition, no pending indicator and no chip; the operator only knew the call
// had succeeded by reading the raw API response. DESIGN §Surface 2's
// "Amendment 2026-07-24 (F22, live soak)" decides BOTH treatments — (a) exactly
// ONE additional silent, keep-last-good status re-load so region 5's m35 chip
// lands within a round trip (A8), and (b) the SAME button reading `Sent`,
// `muted`, disabled, picker frozen, held one poll interval, then decaying to
// rest (A7).
//
// DRIVEN TWO WAYS, deliberately:
//   1. the PURE state machine (ui/src/fleet/assign-affordance.mjs) — the house
//      pattern, since this repo ships no React harness;
//   2. the REAL, UNMODIFIED production <Fleet/> component tree, mounted
//      headlessly against the REAL fleet face, with a real click going through
//      the real api client to the real route and minting a real record on a
//      CONTROLLABLE clock. This is the F-38.06e lesson honoured rather than
//      repeated: *"a state satisfied by calling the reducer directly proved
//      nothing, because production could never drive it."* A pure-helper lane
//      alone would be that defect class again.
//
// REVIEW FIXES (2026-07-24):
//   - QA-b — the two States rows that were reachable ONLY through the reducer
//     (`empty-roster`, `assigning`) are now ALSO read off the RENDERED tree.
//   - QA-c — the "the hold is one poll interval" claim is measured at both
//     CONSUMPTION sites (the app's own poll traffic, the app's own decay),
//     never at the definition where it is a tautology.
//   - F-D — the third, SOURCE-SHAPE lane (the component delegates to the helper;
//     the hold and the poll cadence are ONE number that cannot drift) has moved
//     to the milestone fitness
//     test/arch/ui/acd-fleet-assign-targets-item-workspace.test.mjs. A structural
//     invariant sitting in story acceptance ages with the story.
//
// DG-14 / F-38.04f (2026-07-24, DESIGN §Surface 2 Amendment (b)) — the LAST
// block of lanes in this file arms the States table's NEW row, `timed out (no
// answer)`: a POST that never answers is a REFUSAL, not a limbo. It is driven
// the same way the rest of the file is — the REAL mounted app, a REAL POST to
// the REAL route, with only the response's DELIVERY held (the request is really
// issued and really answered; the app's own await simply stays pending, exactly
// as a hung round trip leaves it) on a controllable clock.
