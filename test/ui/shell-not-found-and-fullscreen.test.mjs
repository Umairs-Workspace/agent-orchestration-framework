// Traceability wiring for milestone 45 / story 03, task 03 —
// `stories/03_story_app-shell-and-entry/tasks/03_unmatched-path-and-fullscreen.feature`
// (@executable).
//
// TWO STATES THAT ARE NOT SURFACES, sharing one rule: neither is allowed to touch the address
// bar. An unmatched path renders IN the shell at the path the operator typed, with the
// navigation right there; fullscreen is a transient view state that gets no path, no query
// parameter and no history entry, so Back is never the way out of it.
//
// THE CHANNEL. The feature's LITMUS: "every Then is a returned VALUE from a framework-free
// `.mjs` module loaded by node:test with no bundler and no DOM — `routeFor` from
// `ui/src/app/routes.mjs`, the entry's own decision plan, the shell's region/state model, and
// the fullscreen state machine that ADR-005 puts in `ui/src/app/shell-layout.mjs`."
//
// PLUS the rendered document where a clause is about the document: that the not-found state
// really renders inside the chrome with the nav usable, and that the presented occupant really
// declares `role="dialog"` / `aria-modal` / its label and really hands focus back to the
// control that opened it.
//
// WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY CANNOT SHOW, and ADR-005 [Build-1] says so itself: the occupant's
// INSTANCE and DOM identity surviving present and dismiss. These scenarios drive a PURE state
// machine, "where instance identity is not observable at all; the violation is therefore
// invisible in 45 and fatal in 46 … the honest pin is a behavioural one in m46, where a real
// socket and a real PTY exist to survive the transition." What IS pinned here is everything the
// machine can carry: the closed transition set, the replace-on-second-request, the no-op
// dismissals, the layout TICK on both transitions, the claimed `Escape`, and the focus restore.
