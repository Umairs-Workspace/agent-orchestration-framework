// Traceability wiring for milestone 43 / story 04 / task 05 —
// tasks/05_resync-requests-fresh-push.feature (@executable).
//
// ONE door per item, on the detail panel's provenance line, present only while
// there is something to repair; it reports the CALL while the provenance line
// reports the DATA; there is NO SUCCESS TOAST, because the badge clearing and the
// age resetting are the only honest proof a push actually landed; and the
// in-flight state is BOUNDED on BOTH legs.
//
// DRIVEN END TO END, PRODUCER-FED. The REAL <Board/> is mounted headlessly
// against the REAL board face on a controllable clock; a real click goes through
// the real api client to the REAL `POST /api/work/resync`, which invokes the REAL
// `work:resync` command against the REAL store — and the REAL control-daemon
// drain (`runResyncDispatchTick`) settles the request row. The ONLY thing stood
// in for is the FABRIC: which node holds a connected admitted socket, and whether
// a dispatch onto it completes. That is a thing a single-process fixture cannot
// BE. Everything downstream of it — the request row, the coded outcomes, the
// route, the command — is production.
//
// WHY "NO SUCCESS TOAST" IS AN ASSERTION AND NOT A STYLE NOTE. `Requested` means
// the request went out; only the age resetting and the badge clearing prove a
// fresh copy arrived. A success toast would confirm the CLICK and let the
// operator believe the DATA is fresh — the exact lie class this board has already
// paid for twice. It is the m38 F22 rule verbatim: "it reports the CALL; region 5
// reports the ASSIGNMENT."
//
// WHY THE DOOR IS COUNTED RATHER THAN INSPECTED. The lane card and the overview
// milestone card are themselves `<button data-card>` elements, and an HTML
// `<button>` may never nest another interactive element (m38/ADR-012). So "no
// Resync on the cards" is a CORRECTNESS constraint, not a preference a future
// designer could revisit — and it is asserted by counting the controls across the
// WHOLE rendered tree rather than by inspecting one component.
//
// ── THE ONE TIMING FACT THIS FILE DEPENDS ON, STATED HONESTLY ───────────────
// `work:resync` writes its request row and reads it back SYNCHRONOUSLY, so the
// first read always sees `requested` and the command always sleeps at least once
// on the board's controllable clock. `face.awaitDispatch(ref)` gates on the REAL
// daemon having drained the queue before the lane advances that clock, so the
// command's first wake is also its last. That is the fixture reproducing the
// real ordering (an always-on daemon, draining on the machine's own clock), not
// a test working around one.
