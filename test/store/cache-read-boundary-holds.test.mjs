// Traceability wiring for milestone 43 / story 06 (the readers migrate), task
//   .../06_story_cache-read-surface/tasks/03_worker-and-structural-readers-stay-on-disk.feature
//
// ADR-005 STAGE 3: the boundary is locked in BOTH directions. The NON-migration is a
// first-class coverage obligation, not an omission.
//
// WHY THIS NEEDS SCENARIOS AND NOT JUST A GUARD: a later well-meaning "finish the migration"
// that moved a worker onto the control's cache would make A WORKER READ SOMEONE ELSE'S
// OPINION OF ITS OWN CHECKOUT — a closed loop in which the control's copy of the worker's
// state becomes the worker's own input, and the value becomes self-reinforcing rather than
// observed. A structural operation moved onto the cache would rename, renumber or rewrite
// against a set that is not the set on disk. Both are behavioural failures with behavioural
// symptoms; both are below.
//
// THE SOURCE-LEVEL POSITIVE ASSERTION IS NOT HERE — "these modules still import work.mjs's
// disk readers" lives in `acd-cache-read-surface-boundary`. What is here is the BEHAVIOUR
// that assertion protects.
//
// NON-VACUITY IS THE WHOLE RISK IN THIS FILE, and it is designed for explicitly. An assertion
// that a reader did NOT migrate can pass because nothing migrated, because the fixture never
// made the two sides disagree, or because the cache was empty. Every scenario below therefore
// (a) makes the two sides disagree DELIBERATELY and asserts that the disagreement is visible
// from the OTHER side too, so a fixture in which the cache says nothing would fail its own
// precondition, and (b) where a positive/negative pair exists, asserts BOTH — the cache-only
// ref draws nothing AND the on-disk fact still draws its finding. The suite was additionally
// verified by MUTATION: pointing each pinned reader at the seam turns the matching scenarios
// red (recorded in the story's build report).
