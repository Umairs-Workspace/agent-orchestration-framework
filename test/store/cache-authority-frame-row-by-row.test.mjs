// AC5: `applyDeltaFrame` collapses to a call on the shared seam — its read-merge-
// republish dance existed only to feed the wholesale writer — and that RETIRES its P0.3
// hazard, recorded in its own source comment: "one partial delta rolls back the ENTIRE
// BEGIN IMMEDIATE txn and silently drops every OTHER item in the same frame". The same
// collapse applies to `applySnapshotFrame`, which used to feed the frame's items to the
// wholesale writer and therefore REPLACED the whole workspace's rows with whatever
// subtree the worker happened to send.
//
// THE LITMUS: a fresh read of the cached rows plus the frame apply's own RESULT — the
// counted skips and coded refusals it returns. No source read: "there is no longer a
// whole-workspace transaction" is proven by what SURVIVES a bad row, never by reading
// the transaction's absence.
