//
// ADR-005's doctor clause. `work-doctor` does NOT simply move. `doctorWork` still builds its
// snapshot ONCE from disk and its pure `(snapshot, ctx) => Finding[]` group architecture is
// untouched; before the groups run, the BUILDER overlays cache-authoritative facts onto each
// row, stamping the SOURCE of each. `statusCoherenceGroup` and `lifecycleCompletenessGroup`
// then read the authoritative status without changing their source OR their signature.
// `freshnessGroup` stays disk-only and explicitly so.
//
// THE LITMUS, and its one honest limit. Every Then is confirmable from `aof work doctor
// --json`: the PRESENCE or ABSENCE of a finding by `code`, its `severity`, its `path`, and
// its `message`. That is the whole channel — a Finding is `{ code, severity, path, message }`
// and nothing else. `statusFrom` is an INTERNAL snapshot stamp with no black-box channel, so
// it is verified only through its consequences. Where a scenario needs to know WHICH SIDE the
// authoritative status came from, it reads the finding's MESSAGE, which ADR-010/R6.2 makes a
// required contract.
//
// THE DECISIVE PAIR is the point of the whole file: identical disk, identical cache values,
// OPPOSITE verdicts, decided by `node_id` alone. Both halves are asserted, because either one
// on its own is satisfiable by a doctor that has simply stopped checking.
