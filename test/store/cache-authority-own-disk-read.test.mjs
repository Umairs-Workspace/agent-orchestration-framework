// Traceability wiring for milestone 43 / story 02 (the authority cut), task
//   .../02_story_cache-authority/tasks/07_own-disk-read-primitive-unchanged.feature
//
// The REGRESSION GUARDS this story owes, stated positively rather than left alone
// (ADR-005's discipline: a negative-only guard cannot catch a well-meaning "finish the
// migration"). The read primitive is NOT the disease — the wholesale delete-and-rebuild
// wrapped around it was — so `readWorkspaceProjectionItems` must come out of this story
// doing exactly what it did going in: reading the CALLING node's own disk to report its
// own state, which is also how the WORKER builds the frame it streams. And no reader
// migrates here: moving readers onto the cache is 43/06, wave 3, deliberately last.
//
// THE LITMUS: outsider channels only — the rows the read returns compared against a
// fresh `aof work list --json` over the SAME work dir (both are disk reads of the same
// stream), the values that reach the control's cached rows after a worker reports, and
// the shape of the rows the fleet payload / board overlay still render.
