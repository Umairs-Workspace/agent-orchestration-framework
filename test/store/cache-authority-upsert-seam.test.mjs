// Traceability wiring for milestone 43 / story 02 (the authority cut), task
//   .../02_story_cache-authority/tasks/01_one-upsert-seam-stamped-by-the-writing-node.feature
//
// AC2: ONE row-level upsert seam — the structural twin of `upsertWorkItemContent` —
// used by BOTH writers: the control's publish with its own node id, and the worker's
// frame with the CONNECTION-AUTHENTICATED node id, never a self-reported one (the rule
// `applyWorktreeContentFrame` already keeps).
//
// THE LITMUS, as the task's header sets it: a fresh read of the cached rows through the
// store's public read surface, or the seam's own result counts. Authorship is proved the
// COLUMN-FREE way wherever it can be — by WHOSE RETRACTION THE ROW OBEYS (task 02's
// rule: a node may retract only what it authored), because a row stamped `worker-a`
// behaves differently from one stamped `worker-b` in exactly that observable way.
//
// The provenance READBACK the feature's Outline flags as 43/04-gated is asserted here
// against the COLUMN this story writes (`work_items.node_id`, schema v8, which ADR-010/D2
// moved into this story precisely because the retraction predicate has to read it). The
// storage->wire mapper that renders it as `reportedBy` on the read surface stays 43/04's;
// what is proved here is the STAMP, which is this story's half.
