// Traceability wiring for milestone 43 / story 06 (the readers migrate), task
//   .../06_story_cache-read-surface/tasks/00_seam-answers-cache-first-with-reported-fallback.feature
//
// ADR-005 STAGE 0: the cache-first read seam EXISTS and is proven against a fixture. It
// exposes cache-first equivalents of `work.mjs`'s four disk readers, each returning rows
// stamped with provenance, each falling back to disk EXPLICITLY when the cache cannot answer.
//
// THE LITMUS, as the task's header sets it: every Then is confirmable from (a) the seam
// call's own returned rows — their `answeredFrom` / `reportedBy` / `syncedAt` — or (b) the
// durable degrade sink's coded entries, an artefact the system WROTE. No source is read.
//
// ONE DEVIATION, DECLARED RATHER THAN HIDDEN. Two Thens in this feature are conditioned on
// the build being AT stage 0 — "a fresh `aof work find 02 --json` still resolves nothing (no
// call site has moved at stage 0)" and the whole zero-blast-radius scenario. This story
// delivers stages 0 THROUGH 3 in one build, so at HEAD those call sites HAVE moved and the
// CLI answers from the cache by design (task 02 requires exactly that of the same commands).
// The two claims are therefore asserted here in the form that is TRUE of the delivered
// build and that carries the same guarantee — the seam is purely ADDITIVE: `work.mjs`'s
// four disk readers, called directly, still see the disk and only the disk, cache or no
// cache. Flagged to the PO, not papered over.
//
// THE ORDERING HALF IS PROVED BY MUTATION, AND THE MUTATION IS RE-RUNNABLE (m43/ADR-016/G9 —
// "a mutation nobody can re-run is an assertion"). The harness is checked in, names its two
// mutations, aborts if either target has moved, and restores the source byte-for-byte with a
// sha256 check:
//
//     node wiki/work/43_milestone_mesh-artifact-authority/reference/staging-mutations.mjs
//
// It reverts ONE migrated call site at a time and prints the mutant's answers beside the
// unmutated baseline's. Measured 2026-08-04, from the repo root:
//
//     BASELINE (stage 3)          work find 02 → 1 row | work list holds 02: true  | work doc 02: present
//     MUTANT stage0-leaf-find     work find 02 → 0 rows| work list holds 02: true  | work doc 02: present
//     MUTANT stage1-leaves-unmoved work find 02 → 1 row| work list holds 02: FALSE | work doc 02: present
//
// Row 2 is task 00's staging Then ("no call site has moved at stage 0" ⇒ `work find 02`
// resolves nothing); row 3 is task 01's ("at stage 1 the leaves have not moved" ⇒ the leaf
// misses 02 while the CHOKEPOINT already answers for it). Neither state can coexist with
// stage 3 in one tree, which is why they are here rather than in a lane below.
