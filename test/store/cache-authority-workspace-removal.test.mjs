// Traceability wiring for milestone 43 / story 02 (the authority cut), task
//   .../02_story_cache-authority/tasks/06_deliberate-workspace-row-removal.feature
//
// AC7: a workspace's rows can still be removed ON PURPOSE, but only through an
// explicitly NAMED path — never through the publish tick. This is a real coverage
// obligation rather than a footnote, because the sweep that used to carry it is gone
// with AC1, and author retraction (AC4) deliberately cannot do it: no node may remove
// another node's rows, so nothing else in the system can ever clear a worker-authored
// row for a workspace being forgotten.
//
// THE NAMED PATH, this story's to choose: `removeWorkspaceFromCache(store, workspaceId)`
// — one explicit, operator-initiated call, not a flag on the publish. Per the QA-proposed
// bound the feature carries, it clears the workspace's WHOLE cache footprint (rows AND
// cached artifact bodies / run records), because a path that cleared only `work_items`
// would leave the artifact rows orphaned under an id nothing will ever publish again —
// the same "removable only by a sweep that no longer exists" corner one level down.
