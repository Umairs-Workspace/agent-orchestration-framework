// Traceability wiring for milestone 43 / story 02 (the authority cut), task
//   wiki/work/43_milestone_mesh-artifact-authority/stories/02_story_cache-authority/
//     tasks/00_work-items-is-a-fact-not-a-rebuilt-projection.feature
//
// AC1: `work_items` is reclassified projection -> fact in effects/stores.mjs, and THE
// RECLASSIFICATION IS THE ENFORCEMENT — `wholesaleDelete` already throws before it runs
// for any table not classified "projection", so the control's delete-and-rebuild cannot
// survive the reclassification even by accident. The cut is scoped to exactly ONE table:
// `projection_errors`, swept on the very next line, stays a projection and keeps being
// rebuilt per publish.
//
// THE LITMUS CHANNELS, exactly as the task's header names them — no source read:
//   (a) the CODED ERROR a wholesale sweep now raises (`fact-table-wholesale-delete`),
//       reached through the guard's own exported door;
//   (b) a fresh read of the workspace's CACHED ROWS through the store's public read
//       surface (`readWorkspaceItems`);
//   (c) the publish call's own RESULT ENVELOPE plus the workspace's `last_published_at`.
// "The sweep call no longer exists anywhere in src/" is a source ABSENCE and stays the
// arch-test's job (acd-work-items-single-writer, armed at this cut; and the amended
// acd-fact-projection-split), never a scenario's.
