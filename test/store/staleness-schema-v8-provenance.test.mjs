//
// AC 1 / AC 2: opening a pre-v8 store lands `node_id` + `updated_at` on `work_items`
// through a GUARDED, IDEMPOTENT `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN` — never a table rebuild —
// leaves every existing row intact and UNSTAMPED, and touches neither content table.
//
// THE LITMUS, as the task's header sets it: every Then is confirmable by OPENING THE STORE
// BACK UP and reading it — the `aof_schema` version row, `PRAGMA table_info(<table>)`'s
// column list, `sqlite_master`'s own CREATE text, and the rows themselves. No source is
// read; the migration is judged by the shape and content of the database it leaves behind.
// The v7 fixture is built the backcompat-migrate way — write a store at the OLD version and
// re-open it with this build — never by hand-editing a schema the migration then agrees
// with. (`ALTER TABLE … RENAME TO` is how a pre-3.35 SQLite models an authentically-old
// file, the idiom mesh-assignment-record.test.mjs already uses for the v3→v4 clone_url
// migration; the point is that the FILE is genuinely v7-shaped before this build sees it.)
//
// WHY A REBUILD IS FORBIDDEN AND MUST BE ASSERTED RATHER THAN ASSUMED: `CREATE TABLE IF NOT
// EXISTS` never adds a column to an already-existing table, so the only two ways to land the
// columns are the guarded ALTER or a drop-and-recreate. A rebuild would be INVISIBLE in a
// green "the column exists" assertion and would silently destroy every row a worker had
// streamed — which under ADR-004 is unrecoverable FACT, not a re-derivable projection. So
// what is asserted below is the SURVIVAL of the data and the IDEMPOTENCE of the step, which
// is what actually distinguishes the two implementations.
//
// SCHEMA OWNERSHIP: the migration itself is 43/02's (ADR-010/D2 moved it there — its
// retraction predicate cannot read a column that does not exist). This file is 43/04's
// CONFIRMATION that the five properties its own read side depends on genuinely hold against
// what shipped, and it is the regression net if a future bump reaches for a rebuild.
