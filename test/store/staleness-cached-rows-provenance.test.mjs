// Traceability wiring for milestone 43 / story 04 (staleness, never eviction), task
//   .../04_story_staleness-and-resync/tasks/01_cached-rows-carry-provenance.feature
//
// AC 3 / AC 5 / AC 6: every cached row and artifact carries WHO reported it and WHEN, under
// the STORAGE names in the store (`node_id`/`updated_at`) and the WIRE names on the response
// (`reportedBy`/`syncedAt`), with the configured staleness window on the list response
// exactly once.
//
// THE LITMUS, as the task's header sets it: every Then is confirmable from two observable
// artefacts and nothing else — (a) a store row read back out of an isolated global store,
// and (b) the JSON the board's `/api/work/list` route actually serialises (and the JSON
// `aof work list --json` prints). No source is read. "One mapper" is asserted only where it
// has an OBSERVABLE consequence: the row and the artifact produce the SAME key names and the
// SAME unknown-shape for the same underlying fact.
//
// THE MEASURED GAP THIS CLOSES: the board's per-item wire shape carried no `syncedAt` at
// all, and `reportedBy` was set ONLY on the child rows the worker merge INSERTS — never on
// the rows it MERGES. So attribution was accidental and partial: the item you are actually
// looking at was the one least likely to say who reported it.
