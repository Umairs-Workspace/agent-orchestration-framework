// Traceability wiring for milestone 43 / story 06 (the readers migrate), task
//   .../06_story_cache-read-surface/tasks/01_resolve-chokepoint-moves-eight-commands.feature
//
// ADR-005 STAGE 1: `src/commands/resolve.mjs` moves onto the seam. ONE edit; the graph's
// eight dependents — `continue`, `doc`, `feedback`, `run-complete`, `run-retry`, `run-start`,
// `run-status`, `tasks` — all migrate behind it.
//
// THE HEADLINE OUTCOME LIVES HERE: a work item authored by a REMOTE worker reads correctly on
// the control node AFTER the worker's worktree has been deleted, when the control's own disk
// holds only the stale pre-run scaffold. That is the case the milestone's own accept note
// records as having FAILED on a live two-node run.
//
// THE LITMUS: every Then is confirmable from a command's `--json` document — the resolved
// ref, the answering side stamped on the answer, the body returned, a coded failure and its
// exit — or from the control node's on-disk tree being unchanged. No source is read.
//
// ONE DEVIATION, DECLARED. The final scenario ("at stage 1 the leaves have not moved") asks a
// single tree to be simultaneously at stage 1 and at stage 3; this story delivers all four
// stages, and task 02 REQUIRES the same three leaves to have moved. It is asserted here as
// the property that IS true of the delivered build and that the scenario exists to establish —
// the chokepoint edit alone carries exactly its eight dependents — and the stage-1 claim
// itself was verified by MUTATION (reverting the three leaf edits and re-running), recorded
// in the story's build report. Flagged to the PO rather than papered over.
