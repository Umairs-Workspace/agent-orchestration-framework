// Traceability wiring for milestone 43 / story 04 (staleness, never eviction), task
//   .../04_story_staleness-and-resync/tasks/02_stale-marks-never-evicts.feature
//
// AC 2 / AC 4 / AC 6 / AC 12: what the window actually DOES — it MARKS. The shared strict-`>`
// predicate decides freshness for two subjects (the row and each artifact), a missing instant
// yields `unknown` rather than `stale`, and no row is ever removed because it got old. The
// only sanctioned removal in the whole cache is ADR-004's author retraction, predicated on
// authorship and ref-set membership.
//
// THE LITMUS, as the task's header sets it: every Then is confirmable from a value the
// server-side read boundary RETURNS for a planted store state at an INJECTED `now` — the
// freshness verdict on a serialised row, the verdict on a serialised artifact, and the row's
// own content read back after the fact. No source read and no wall clock.
//
// WHERE THE VERDICT COMES FROM, and why it is not a row field. The window is ONE number for
// the whole response (task 01: "no individual row carries a window, a threshold or a
// pre-computed stale flag of its own"), so the boundary is the shared predicate APPLIED to a
// serialised record with the window taken off the SAME serialised envelope the board sends.
// Every verdict below is therefore computed exactly the way a reader must compute it, from
// facts that actually crossed the wire — never from a flag the server pre-baked.
//
// WHY THE BOUNDARY IS THE WHOLE TASK. The predicate is strict `>` — `now − syncedAt > window`
// — so a record EXACTLY AT the window is still FRESH (`300 > 300` is false). That is not a
// detail: DESIGN has the badge recomputed in the BROWSER against a live 1-second tick, so the
// rule genuinely runs on two sides of the wire and the two must agree at the threshold
// instant. A `>=` implementation passes every other row in the first Outline and fails only
// the one named "EXACTLY at the window".
