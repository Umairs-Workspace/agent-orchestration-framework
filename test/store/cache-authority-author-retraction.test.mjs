// Traceability wiring for milestone 43 / story 02 (the authority cut), task
//   .../02_story_cache-authority/tasks/02_author-retraction-is-the-only-deletion.feature
//
// AC4: deletion is by AUTHOR RETRACTION, never by a sweep and never by time. A
// publishing node passes the full ref set it is authoritative for, and the seam deletes
// rows where `node_id = <this node> AND ref NOT IN <that set>`. A node may retract ONLY
// what it itself authored; it may never delete another node's row; and NO deletion may
// ever be predicated on a timestamp.
//
// THE LITMUS is deliberately the COLUMN-FREE one: a fresh read of the cached rows
// through the store's public read surface — the row is either still readable or it is
// not. Survival-vs-deletion proves authorship without reading a provenance column.
//
// A scenario cannot prove an absence, so the never-evict rule is asserted here as the
// OBSERVABLE outcome (the ancient row is still readable after tick upon tick), never as
// "no time-predicated DELETE exists" — that is the arch-test's job
// (acd-cache-staleness-single-predicate).
