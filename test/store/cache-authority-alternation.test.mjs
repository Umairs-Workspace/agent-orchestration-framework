// AC6, THE CENTREPIECE — ADR-004's own prose fitness criterion made executable: publish,
// stream a worker delta, publish again, and assert THE WORKER'S ROW SURVIVES. Its sibling
// is the case that fails PERMANENTLY today: after a successful push the worker removes
// its worktree and never ticks again, while the control keeps publishing from a disk that
// still holds the pre-run scaffold.
//
// THE LITMUS: a fresh read of the cached rows through the store's public read surface,
// plus the publish tick's own result counts. No assertion about cadence, sleep or timing —
// the proof is that N further control ticks against an UNCHANGED control disk never move
// the worker's row.
