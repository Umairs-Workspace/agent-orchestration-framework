// Traceability wiring for milestone 43 / story 02 (the authority cut), task
//   .../02_story_cache-authority/tasks/04_contention-is-decided-by-the-assignment-lock.feature
//
// AC3: contention at the upsert seam is decided by the ADR-003 assignment lock, never by
// a timestamp race. While an assignment covers a ref's execution scope, an upsert for
// that ref is accepted ONLY from the holder — in the ONE rule's two renderings:
//   AUTOMATIC (the control's periodic publish tick) -> skip the ref and COUNT the skip
//     in the tick's result; a coded refusal per held item per tick is log spam and the
//     tick asked nothing;
//   OPERATOR-INITIATED (a human-driven control-side verb) -> refuse, coded and loud,
//     with `item-locked-by-assignment`.
//
// SCOPE BOUNDARY, honoured: the lock PREDICATE (which assignments are active, what
// execution scope covers, the shape of the refusal payload) is 43/01's contract and is
// not re-specified here. This file specifies only what the UPSERT SEAM does when the
// predicate says a ref is held — and it is the same ground 43/01's task 05 covers from
// the other side, so `test/work/item-lock-operator-vs-automatic.test.mjs` is its sibling and
// stays green against this story's replacement mechanism, not a forked one.
//
// THE OPERATOR DOOR used below is `work:run-start` — ADR-003's own first example of an
// operator verb, and the one control-side door that both (a) sits behind the item lock
// and (b) propagates the control's disk through publish-on-mutate, so "the operator's
// value" is observable in the cached row. Which verb is 43/01's choice, not this
// story's; what this file pins is what the SEAM does on either side of it.
