// Traceability wiring for milestone 43 / story 06 (the readers migrate), task
//   .../06_story_cache-read-surface/tasks/02_control-side-leaves-migrate-independently.feature
//
// ADR-005 STAGE 2: the remaining control-side leaves migrate onto the seam, each
// independently revertible. With `next`, `find` and `list` migrated, ALL SIX surfaces the
// operator touches (`next`/`find`/`list` + stage 1's `doc`/`tasks`/`run-status`) read a
// remote-authored item correctly after the worker's worktree is gone.
//
// THE LITMUS: every Then is confirmable from a command's `--json` document, or — for the two
// leaves with no verb of their own — from an outcome a verb CAN see. No source is read.
//
// THE REACH-THROUGH obligation is the recurring shape here: a cache-answered row's `dir` is
// not on this node, and every leaf that reads THROUGH a row into its folder must never crash,
// never fabricate a path, and never emit a record whose `source` does not resolve to real
// text. The three leaves that do so (`run-start`'s fleet sweep, `memory/local-indexing`,
// `notion/sync-work`) SKIP those rows and REPORT the skip on the durable degrade sink — which
// is an observable a disk-only enumeration structurally cannot produce, and is therefore what
// makes the assertion about the migration rather than about the fallback.
