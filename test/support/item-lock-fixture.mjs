// It is `mesh-assign-fixture.mjs` widened along the ONE axis this story needs: an
// ARBITRARY work stream (the features talk about milestones "42", "43", "44" and the
// string-prefix near-miss "420", each with its own stories) rather than that fixture's
// fixed `35_milestone_demo`. Everything else is reused verbatim from there —
// `seedTargetNode` (the two store facts the assign verb's repo gate reads) and
// `seedAssignment` (a direct-insert `global_assignments` row for a "Given an ACTIVE
// assignment …" background) are IMPORTED, never re-implemented, so a row this suite
// plants is byte-identical to the one m35's suites plant.
//
// The real `.aof/templates/work/{milestone,story}` templates are copied in (the
// work-insert-fixture.mjs discipline) because the control-side mutation door is
// exercised through the REAL `work:insert-story` verb, which scaffolds from them.
