// test/support/staleness-fixture.mjs — the shared fixture for milestone 43 / story 04
// (staleness, never eviction: the READ side of schema v8's provenance columns).
//
// It is `cache-authority-fixture.mjs` (story 02's) reused verbatim for everything the two
// stories share — a hermetic AOF_GLOBAL_HOME, a real workspace, the registered descriptor a
// worker frame is checked against, and the two REAL writers (the control's own publish tick
// and a worker's authenticated frame) — with this story's own node names and the three
// things only the read side needs:
//
//   (a) THE SERIALISED LIST RESPONSE, taken from the REAL board over HTTP. The features'
//       litmus is "the JSON the board's `/api/work/list` route actually serialises", so
//       `listResponse` stands up the production board (serveSetupUi → board-ui.mjs) and
//       fetches it. Nothing here re-implements the envelope.
//   (b) THE CONFIGURED WINDOW. `setStalenessWindow` rewrites the workspace's own
//       `.aof/aof.config.json`, which is what a real operator edits and what the face reads
//       per request — never an injected constant.
//   (c) AN INJECTED `now`. Freshness is judged at the read boundary against a supplied
//       instant (the 22/R2 discipline the shared predicate keeps), so `at(seconds)` builds
//       an instant a fixed age before a pinned NOW and every verdict is a test rather than a
//       race.
