// test/support/gate-propagation-fixture.mjs — the shared REAL-GIT fixture family for
// milestone 43 / story 05 (gate-time propagation, ADR-008). Wraps the existing
// `withMeshWorkerExecFixture` / `withMeshWorkerPushFixture` real-local-repo builders and
// adds the ONE thing this story needs that no earlier milestone did: a real ITEM LINE with
// a shape — an item branch cut from an earlier control HEAD and carrying the worker's own
// commits, while the control's HEAD has moved on to a commit carrying a gate edit.
//
// Every shape here is built with a REAL `git` binary against a disposable temp repo (no
// mocked git, no network, no real forge — the milestone's own discipline). The three
// relationships the advance must distinguish are built explicitly rather than implied:
//
//   ALREADY-CURRENT — the item branch is cut from C2 and carries W1/W2, so the pinned base
//                     is already an ancestor of the tip (`cutFrom: "C2"`).
//   BEHIND          — the item branch is cut from C1 and carries NO worker commit, so the
//                     tip is strictly an ancestor of the pinned base (`workerCommits: 0`).
//   DIVERGED        — the item branch is cut from C1 and carries W1/W2 while C2 lands on
//                     the control's own line: neither tip is an ancestor of the other. This
//                     is the COMMON case and the one SPEC/STATE's word "fast-forward"
//                     mis-describes (ADR-008).
//
// `git(cwd, args)` here deliberately never passes `shell: true` (the
// mesh-worker-push-fixture.mjs rationale): on Windows a shell wrapper re-tokenizes each
// argv element on whitespace, silently corrupting any spaced value.
