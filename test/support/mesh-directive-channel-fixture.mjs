// Shared NET-NEW test infrastructure for milestone 35 / story 01 (the control→worker
// command channel): a PERSISTENT, BIDIRECTIONAL fake channel extending the 34/story-04
// one-way fakes (test/mesh/relay/control-stream-server.test.mjs's admission/apply units,
// test/work/worker-stream-client.test.mjs's fakeTransport). Budgeted by STORY.md as "the
// milestone's biggest harness piece" — used across all three task-01 feature files.
//
// WHY NET-NEW: the 34/story-04 fakes are ONE-WAY (worker -> control only, a single
// fake socket per test). Story 01 needs:
//   (a) a SERVER-SIDE fake ws per connected worker, individually addressable and
//       independently closable/erroring — so "worker-a got exactly one frame,
//       worker-b got none" and "worker-a's socket errors, worker-b's is untouched"
//       are directly observable, matching real ws@8's per-socket close/error
//       semantics `sendDirective`/the targeting map depend on (readyState, etc);
//   (b) a DOWN-CHANNEL delivery path INTO a worker-side onMessage handler — the
//       34/story-04 fakeTransport has no such path (it is send-only, matching the
//       PRE-story-01 worker-stream-client.mjs);
//   (c) an ORDERED PER-SOCKET frame recorder on the server's fan-in side (which
//       frames the SERVER received from which worker) — reused from 34/story-04's
//       applyStreamFrame-driven pattern, unchanged;
//   (d) a scriptable MID-STREAM drop (closing/erroring one named worker's socket
//       without touching any other worker's).
import { WebSocket } from "ws";

// createFakeServerSocket(nodeId) — a MINIMAL stand-in for a real `ws` connection
// object, carrying exactly the surface control-stream-server.mjs's sendDirective
// touches (`readyState`, `send`) plus an ordered recorder of every frame written to
// it (so "worker-a's socket received exactly one frame" is a plain array assertion).

    },
    // close()/error() — a scriptable mid-stream drop: flips readyState CLOSED
    // (mirroring ws@8's own constant) so a subsequent sendDirective resolving THIS
    // socket sees it as no-longer-open, exactly as the real close/error handlers'
    // directiveTargets.deleteIfCurrent would have already removed it from the map —
    // both paths are exercised by the fixture below (removeWorker calls both).
