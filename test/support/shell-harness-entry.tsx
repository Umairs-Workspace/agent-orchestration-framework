// The mount entry for the app-shell harness (milestone 45 / story 03).
//
// `withMountedApp` mounts one exported component with NO props — every existing surface
// (`<Fleet/>`, `<Board/>`) is propless, and the shell is not: the entry hands it the route the
// table resolved, the address it resolved it from, and the surface element to mount. So this
// file is the shell's propless wrapper, reading its props from a global the lane sets before
// the bundle is imported. It is the ONLY thing between the lane and the REAL production
// `ui/src/app/Shell.tsx`; nothing about the shell is stubbed.
//
// The stub SURFACE is deliberate and is itself part of what a lane checks: it contributes to
// the shell's slot and notice rail through the REAL `SurfaceSlot` and the REAL shell bus, so a
// lane exercises the whole surface → shell channel rather than a mock of it. What it does NOT
// do is fetch anything or want a DOM canvas, which is the same reason the fleet's xterm view
// and the board's dock are stubbed in their own harnesses.

// lane that wants to ask the shell to present something must reach THIS copy — the one the
// mounted shell is listening on. Publishing it here is the seam; it exists only in the test
// tree, and production reaches the bus the way a surface does: by importing it.
