// test/support/cache-read-fixture.mjs — the shared fixture for milestone 43 / story 06
// (the readers migrate: the cache becomes the READ surface).
//
// It is `cache-authority-fixture.mjs` (story 02's) reused verbatim for everything the two
// stories share — a hermetic AOF_GLOBAL_HOME, a real workspace carrying an arbitrary work
// stream, the registered descriptor a worker frame is checked against, the two REAL writers
// (the control's publish tick and a worker's authenticated frame), and the control-disk
// edits (`writeItem` / `deleteItem` / `breakItem` / `removeStream`) — plus the four things
// only the READ side needs:
//
//   (a) THE COMMANDS THEMSELVES. Every scenario in this story is written over a command's
//       `--json` document, so `runCommand` invokes through the SAME command core both faces
//       use, with the fixture's hermetic store options threaded. Nothing re-implements a
//       command's body.
//   (b) A PLANTED CACHE ROW WITH ITS AUTHOR. `plantCacheRow` writes a complete row through
//       the store with an EXPLICIT `node_id`/`updated_at`, which is how a fixture models
//       "last reported by the REMOTE node aof-wsl" without standing up a second machine.
//   (c) THE DEGRADE SINK, capturable. ADR-005's fallback is an EXPLICIT, REPORTED degrade,
//       and the feature files name the sink's coded entries as the observable — so the
//       fixture injects a recording sink through `degrade.mjs`'s own test seam rather than
//       reading a log file. `setDegradeSinkForTest` also clears the per-code throttle, which
//       is what makes each scenario's count its own.
//   (d) A TORN STORE. "present but TORN / unreadable" is a real state a control node reaches
//       and one of the four the seam must answer through, so it is producible here.

// Story 02's `workerWorktree` builds a genuine second directory — which is exactly right for

// temp path and leaves its workspace id path-derived. Against THIS story's boundary both

//     ASSIGNMENT's workspaceId — the control's — which is precisely what makes an
//     over-migration dangerous.
//   · an ARBITRARY PATH means the seam's own worktree check cannot recognise it. A real
//     worktree lives at `<origin>/.aof/mesh/worktrees/<assignmentId>` — `meshWorktreePath`,
//     "THE ONE SEAM" (m35/ADR-004) — and is built here through that same path builder, so the
