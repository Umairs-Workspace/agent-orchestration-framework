// The REAL board face on a loopback port, over a REAL work stream on disk and an
// isolated global store (milestone 43 / story 04 — the substrate the board mount
// harness runs against).
//
// "REAL board face" means the production `handleWorkApi` (src/board-ui.mjs) — the
// module that owns `/api/work/*` — answering every route: list, doc, tasks,
// run-status, next, validate. The app under test therefore speaks HTTP to the
// same handler the desktop board speaks to, through its own api client, in its
// own order. Nothing about the routing, the command core, the workspace
// resolution or the row shapes is stood in for.
//
// PROVENANCE IS PRODUCER-FED, NOT PAINTED ON. A lane says "this workspace was
// reported by <node> at <instant>" by making the REAL publisher write exactly
// that into the REAL store (`publishWorkspaceSnapshot`, which stamps `node_id` +
// `updated_at` on every row it upserts). The face then reads it back through the
// production row mapper (`cache-provenance.mjs`'s `toWireProvenance`) and serves
// it on the envelope. So a green lane means the store recorded it, the mapper
// mapped it and the route served it — the m38/ADR-008 producer-fed rule, applied
// to the fact this whole story is about. The window travels the same way: it is
// CONFIGURED in the workspace's own `.aof/aof.config.json` and resolved by the
// face's own resolver, never injected into the response.
//
// ── THE ONE RESPONSE-LEVEL SEAM, NAMED HONESTLY ─────────────────────────────
// `withdrawWindow()` drops `stalenessSeconds` from the envelope. That is a
// producer this face cannot BE — the real resolver always answers a number — but
// it is a wire state `ui/` must survive without inventing a threshold of its own
// (DESIGN §Surface 3's words-never-a-number degrade), so it is exercised at the
// response boundary and nowhere else. Everything else here goes through the
// store.
