// The `direct` fabric (2026-07-27) — the NO-OVERLAY fabric and the two changes it
// forced: a registration override for a machine that cannot describe itself, and
// connection identity by enrollment credential rather than by remote address.
//
// Covered here:
//   - probeFabric/selfAddress/resolvePeers on `direct` (no spawn, injected seams),
//     including the ONE genuine degrade (no bindable address) and the guarantee that
//     the tailscale branch is untouched;
//   - `mesh:identity --name/--address` — the hostname-collision escape hatch (a WSL2
//     guest inherits the Windows hostname, so BOTH its derived nodeId and its
//     advertised host collide with its host's), and its survival across reload and a
//     hostname change (the self-heal carve-out);
//   - credential admission over a REAL loopback socket: admitted with an EMPTY fabric
//     peer list, refused for absent/unknown/REVOKED credentials, and attributed to the
//     credential's nodeId rather than anything the client declared.
