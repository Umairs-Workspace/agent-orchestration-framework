// Traceability wiring for milestone 35 / story 01 — task 01
// (tasks/01_directive-admission.feature). Covers every @executable scenario /
// Scenario Outline row:
//   - a directive is honored only over an admitted tailnet-peer connection
//     (Scenario Outline, 2 rows: tailnet peer / non-peer host)
//   - a revoked issuer's directive never routes; a non-revoked issuer's does
//     (Scenario Outline, 3 rows)
//   - a node revoked after issuing is filtered on the next directive it sends
//     (LIVE re-read)
//   - an absent registry leaves an admitted issuer's directive routing normally
//     (fail-safe)
//
// Driven over dispatchDirectiveOverTargets — the composed T5+T2 entry point — with
// the INJECTED bidirectional fake channel (test/support/
// mesh-directive-channel-fixture.mjs) standing in for the targeting map (populated
// ONLY post-admission, exactly as wss.on("connection") does) and an injected
// getMeshRegistry() closure standing in for the LIVE mesh registry (SECURITY T2's
// per-decision re-read, mirroring mesh-registry.mjs's own live re-read discipline).
// No live tailnet — the real non-peer dial being refused is the milestone's @manual
// soak (story 02).
