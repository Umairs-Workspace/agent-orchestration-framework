// test/mesh/terminal/mesh-terminal-mirror-reconnect.test.mjs — VERIFICATION (relay-subscriber
// reconnect, live soak 2026-07-25).
//
// THE DEFECT, measured REPEATEDLY on the live control node: the fleet UI and the relay
// broker live in TWO processes (`aof mesh ui` / `aof mesh serve --serve`), and every
// deploy restarts both. `startTerminalMirrorSubscriber` connected EXACTLY ONCE and, on
// failure, set `connected:false` FOREVER — no retry, no reconnect, no drop handler. The
// UI boots in ~1s while the broker must bind the fabric + open the store first, so the UI
// reliably LOST the race, gave up permanently, and EVERY terminal view read `waiting for
// output` until a human restarted the UI process. To the operator that is indistinguishable
// from the terminal feature being broken — and it recurred on every single deploy.
//
// These lanes pin the fix at the seam: the subscriber RETRIES on the shared backoff ladder
// until the broker appears, recovers from a post-open DROP, and never reconnects after
// stop(). The timers are injected, so the retry loop is driven with no wall clock.
