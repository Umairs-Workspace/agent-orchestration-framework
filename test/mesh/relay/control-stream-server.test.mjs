// Traceability wiring for milestone 34 / story 04 — task 02
// (tasks/02_control-node-stream-server.feature). Covers every @executable scenario /
// Scenario Outline row:
//   - the server admits a tailnet peer and refuses a non-peer (Scenario Outline, 2
//     rows), with a refused connection writing NOTHING to the global store
//   - an admitted worker's snapshot and deltas are applied to the global store (the
//     completed item ends up "done")
//   - secret-shaped fields are redacted before entering the global store
//   - a worker's stream liveness label follows its connection and heartbeat
//     (Scenario Outline, 3 rows: live / stale / disconnected)
//
// Driven over the pure admission/apply/label functions directly (the STORY.md build
// note's "task 01's paired fake channel" pattern generalised to the server side) plus
// an injected peer-identity signal mirroring mesh-fabric's injected exec — no live
// tailnet, no real ws socket needed for these units (the real-transport accept loop
// is exercised end-to-end by startControlStreamServer itself, used here over an
// ephemeral loopback port with an injected origin resolver).
