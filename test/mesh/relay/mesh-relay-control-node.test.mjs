// Traceability wiring for milestone 23 / story 01 — task 02
// (tasks/02_control-node-role.feature). The control node is a re-nominate-able config role
// (config.mesh.relay.controlNode = the nominated node id; config.mesh.relay.url = the
// peer-push endpoint); standing up relay mode READS that config and serves ONLY when this
// node is nominated; re-nomination is a config edit on a different node (NO election); and
// losing the control node loses LIVENESS, not DATA — every durable record on disk is
// byte-unchanged across the relay's death.
//
// Covers EVERY @executable scenario in-process: relayMode(config, { port }) is the config
// gate (serves → { server, url, stop } when nominated; null otherwise — a clean no-op, no
// listener bound, the resolved QA flag #3). No spawned second OS process. The byte-
// unchanged invariant records on-disk record bytes, calls stop(), and re-reads.
