// Traceability wiring for milestone 24 / story 02 — task 00 (tasks/00_relay-auth-gate
// .feature). serveRelay's ws upgrade handler CHECKS a connecting node's credential against
// the LIVE roster/revocation before brokering: a valid credential is admitted (joins the
// clients fan-out set + receives brokered frames); an absent / invalid / not-in-roster /
// REVOKED one is destroyed upstream of the broker (socket.destroy(), never joins clients);
// loopback stays the local default (no credential needed); the relay persists NOTHING at
// the gate.
//
// Covers EVERY @executable scenario / Scenario Outline row, driving IN-PROCESS ws clients
// (the m23 join-ack pattern) against the REAL serveRelay (src/mesh/relay.mjs) on an
// ephemeral port (port: 0). The registry roster/revocation is seeded via story 00's
// writeRegistry over a temp fixture. The credential is presented on the upgrade via the
// `ws` client options `new WebSocket(url, { headers: { Authorization } })` (the STORY.md
// carrier decision). Loopback-vs-group is driven by the INJECTED isGroupConnection seam
// (every in-process ws client presents 127.0.0.1, so the branch needs a deterministic
// injectable — the STORY.md build note): the seam reads an `x-conn` header the test sets
// per connection ("group" ⇒ credential required; "loopback" ⇒ the local default). The
// relayAuth token is treated as OPAQUE (its entropy + the constant-time compare are the
// security fitness) — asserted is the observable admit/reject behaviour + the byte-stable
// filesystem. One test object per scenario / row group.
