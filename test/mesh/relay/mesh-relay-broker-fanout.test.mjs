// Traceability wiring for milestone 23 / story 01 — task 00
// (tasks/00_relay-broker-fanout.feature). serveRelay stands up a stateless ws@8 broker
// that fans one node's signal out to the OTHER nodes and persists nothing.
//
// Covers EVERY @executable scenario, exercising the REAL in-process serveRelay
// (src/mesh/relay.mjs) over an EPHEMERAL port (port: 0) with an in-process `ws` client —
// NO spawn (the 22/R3 flake is sidestepped by going fully in-process). The ack-on-connect
// (join-confirm) barrier ({ type:'joined' }) is the DETERMINISTIC proof a peer is in the
// broadcast set before the sender publishes — every ordering-sensitive assertion awaits
// each peer's ack first (a raw `open` await is racy: open fires before the server-side
// connection handler has registered the socket). One test object per @executable scenario.
