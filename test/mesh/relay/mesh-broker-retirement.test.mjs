// Traceability wiring for milestone 33 / story 01 — the ws@8 broker retires as the
// liveness transport (tasks/02_broker-retirement.feature, ADR-002.1/.4/.consequence).
//
// Covers the feature's THREE dedicated @executable scenarios (the reused-guard
// Scenario Outline is @executable-by-construction — covered by simply running the
// named arch-tests themselves, not re-implemented here per the feature's own SEAM
// SPLIT note). Exercises the REAL production functions — invoke("mesh:status", …)
// over src/commands/mesh-identity.mjs, src/mesh/fabric.mjs's resolvePeers-shaped
// fixture injection (ctx.fabricPeers, task 01's cutover seam), and src/mesh/store.mjs
// — against a temp fixture repo. No mock/spy of src/mesh/relay.mjs; the "broker never
// started" proof is TWO real facts: (a) a static source-import check (this test's own
// file never imports mesh-relay.mjs, and neither does mesh-identity.mjs — confirmed by
// reading the actual source, not asserting a belief) and (b) mesh:status is driven to
// a FULLY POPULATED render using ONLY the fabric+git seams, with no relay/registry
// enrollment call ever made in this test's own control flow.
//
//   02_broker-retirement.feature —
//     - a node's presence/liveness view is fully populated with the broker never
//       started: mesh:status renders every synced peer + its fabric-sourced liveness,
//       with serveRelay/mesh-presence-subscriber/mesh-presence-cache never in the path;
//     - a peer's liveness is visible with NO device-code enrollment / ws upgrade
//       auth-gate — tailnet membership is the sole admission boundary;
//     - with neither broker nor fabric configured, presence still renders from the
//       reused git floor (no data lost by the broker's removal).
