// Traceability wiring for milestone 38 / story 00
// tasks/04_fleet-session-render.feature — "the fleet NodeCard renders the
// live-session state, with the run winning the primary line".
//
// REVIEW FIX (F1): this render helper (ui/src/fleet/runs.mjs's fleetCurrentWorkLines)
// is fed the REAL production wire shape — `activeRuns: string[]` (bare run ids,
// 23/ADR-002; no workspace attribution) and a `sessions[]` that is ALREADY
// pre-subsumed by the assembler (src/mesh/launcher.mjs's
// assembleCurrentPresenceRecord — see test/mesh/presence/mesh-presence-aggregate-workspaces.test.mjs
// for the "run AND session on the SAME workspace ⇒ the session is dropped before
// publish" assertion, which is where that reconciliation genuinely happens). This
// file exercises ONLY the render helper's own rule: activeRuns non-empty ⇒ the
// aggregate `running N runs` line; every session remaining in the (pre-subsumed)
// `sessions[]` contributes to ONE shared `working · <repo>[, <repo>…] (session)`
// fallback line; neither ⇒ `idle`. node:assert/strict.
