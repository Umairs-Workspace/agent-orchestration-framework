// Supplementary wiring for milestone 35 / story 01 — the WORKER-SIDE half of tasks
// 00/02: worker-stream-client.mjs's FIRST receive listener (onMessage on
// createWorkerWsTransport, wired into connect()) and the down-channel/up-channel
// seam Story 02 depends on (onDirective(handler) / sendAssignmentStatus(...)). No
// literal feature-file scenario names this seam directly (the task features assert
// the CONTROL side's observable behaviour) — this file proves the worker-side half
// of the SAME channel: a directive delivered on the transport reaches a registered
// onDirective handler PARSED, and sendAssignmentStatus emits the up-frame shape
// task 02 specifies, over the SAME injected bidirectional fake channel
// (test/support/mesh-directive-channel-fixture.mjs).
