//
// Covers EVERY @executable scenario / Scenario-Outline row in
// tasks/04_operator-guidance.feature: the healthy-tailscale preflight guidance (self-
// address + same-tailnet/peer-Online/shields-up lines); the per-BackendState
// remediation matrix; the macOS App-Store-CLI-split warn (an INJECTED platform + an
// injected CLI-unreachable signal, exercisable on ANY CI OS); the warn's absence on a
// non-macOS platform; work doctor surfacing the SAME remediation and never
// runtime-auto-fixing. One test object per @executable scenario (Scenario-Outline rows
// folded into one entry iterating the rows). node:assert/strict.
