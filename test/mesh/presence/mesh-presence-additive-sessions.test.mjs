//
// AMENDED by milestone 48 / story 01 (ADR-005), and only where the entry's own shape
// is named. m48 grows the session ENTRY from the m38 four to the FROZEN ORDERED SIX
// `{ sessionId, workspaceId, repo, assistant, lastPingAt, workspaceHasRun }` — an
// INSERTION at the head and an APPEND at the tail, so the m38 four keep their relative
// order and this file's real subject (the RECORD's frozen five-key shape, its m23
// byte-equivalence, and the TTL filter deciding WHICH sessions appear) is untouched.
// The entry-shape expectations below move with the producer rather than being pinned
// to a superseded shape; the ENTRY's own contract now lives in
// test/arch/session/acd-session-entry-frozen-wire.test.mjs.

  // it is a pure key-shape assembler). This drives the REAL readLiveSessions
  // (src/mesh/presence.mjs) — the function that ACTUALLY applies the TTL — against

  // EXPIRED record's absence from the projected array is a genuine, non-vacuous

  // two dropped ws-2-EXPIRED-only rows and the two-assistants row).
