// test/mesh/worker/mesh-worker-completion-detection.test.mjs — VERIFICATION F-38.06h (live
// two-machine soak, 2026-07-25). An interactive `claude` session NEVER exits when a
// directive finishes — it returns to its idle prompt and stays alive — so the driver's
// only `done` signal (`term.onExit`) never fires, and a completed directive read
// `running` forever (measured live: a `/aof:refine 18` that finished at 14:00 was still
// `running` at 14:50, its session parked). The fix detects completion from the
// TRANSCRIPT claude Code writes with zero model cooperation (the last assistant record's
// `stop_reason: "end_turn"`), settling `done` — or `needs-input` when that finished turn
// carries the sentinel. These lanes drive the REAL driveInteractiveClaudeSession over a
// scripted PTY that (like the real one) NEVER exits, and the REAL
// defaultWatchTranscriptCompletion over a REAL transcript file.
