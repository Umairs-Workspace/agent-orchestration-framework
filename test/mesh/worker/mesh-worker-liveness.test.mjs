// m42 wave (b) / TECH_DEBT item 7 — the PTY LIVENESS PROBE. Measured live (run
// 39ec5149, 2026-07-26): the agent process vanished ~11 minutes into a run with no
// onExit ever delivered, so the run — and its assignment — sat `running` for 25+
// minutes while the fleet mirrored a dead process's silence. The probe signal-0s the
// child pid on an interval and settles the run `failed/agent_died` when the OS says
// the process is gone. Pins:
//   - a dead pid settles failed/agent_died (no onExit needed)
//   - a live pid never trips the probe (the run settles via its normal outcome)
//   - a fake PTY without a pid keeps byte-identical behaviour (no probe at all)
