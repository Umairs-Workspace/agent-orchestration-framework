// test/mesh/worker/mesh-worker-driver-session-id.test.mjs — traceability for milestone 38 /
// story 05, task 03 (03_session-id-captured-and-surfaced.feature, ADR-013
// invariant 3) — REWRITTEN under the ADR-013 AMENDMENT (F-38.05, 2026-07-19). The
// interactive session's `session_id` (DISCARDED before this story — mesh-worker-
// execution.mjs read only terminal_reason/stop_reason) is now resolved by the
// TRANSCRIPT-DIR WATCH (`defaultWatchTranscriptSessionId`, ADR-013 amendment) — the
// PRE-amendment `AOF_SESSION_ID:` PTY marker had NO producer (nothing ever printed
// it), so this suite no longer emits that retired marker: it injects
// `watchTranscriptSessionId` through the driver/handler's own seam instead (the
// feature is over INJECTED seams by design — the injected seam is now the transcript
// watch, not a PTY marker). The resolved id is still surfaced on the
// assignment/presence record via sendAssignmentStatus; a watch that resolves no
// session_id (or an empty one) degrades to absent, never a crash.
//
// REVIEW FAST-FOLLOW (2026-07-19, QA coverage gap closed) — the scenarios above all
// drive the driver/handler over an INJECTED `watchTranscriptSessionId` fake; NONE of
// them exercise `defaultWatchTranscriptSessionId`'s OWN real snapshot / first-new-
// basename / deadline / abort logic (the session-id lane injects a fake past it, the
// needs-input lane aborts it before it ever resolves). The "REAL PRODUCER" block below
// drives that function DIRECTLY against a real temp `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` — fakeable
// with no real `claude`, so `@executable`, never `@manual`.
