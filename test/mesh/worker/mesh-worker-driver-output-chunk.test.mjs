// test/mesh/worker/mesh-worker-driver-output-chunk.test.mjs — traceability for milestone 38 /
// story 06 (ADR-014 AMENDMENT 2026-07-19). The FIRST producer link of the
// cross-machine terminal stream: the REAL interactive driver's
// `term.onData -> options.onOutputChunk(chunk, capturedSessionId)` seam
// (mesh-worker-execution.mjs:1002-1017), which the launcher wires to
// `client.sendTerminalFrame`. Previously asserted only STRUCTURALLY
// (acd-terminal-stream-transport-wired names the literal key); this drives the SHIPPED
// producer end-to-end from a REAL PTY output stream.
//
// PRODUCER-FED + broad-blast-safe (the milestone's hard rules): driven over the REAL
// driveInteractiveClaudeSession against a scripted node-pty double (createScriptedPty)
// and a stubbed `which` — NEVER a real `claude`/node-pty/PTY (a real `claude` on PATH
// would hang forever). The transcript-dir watch is an INJECTED gate a test resolves on
// demand, so the "an early chunk carries a null session, a later chunk carries the
// captured id" mid-stream-capture behaviour (ADR-013 amendment / ADR-014 invariant 4:
// an unresolvable frame is dropped downstream, never delivered to the wrong card) is
// exercised deterministically.
