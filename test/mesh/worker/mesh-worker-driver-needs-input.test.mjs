// story 05, task 02 (02_needs-input-outcome-and-worktree-retention.feature, ADR-013
// invariant 4). An explicit `NEEDS_INPUT` sentinel observed in the interactive
// session's OWN PTY output yields a THIRD outcome, `needs-input` — distinct from, and
// NEVER re-mapped to, `done`. A `needs-input` session RETAINS its worktree (the
// `failed`-style retention branch, mesh-worker-execution.mjs), never the `done`
// force-remove.
