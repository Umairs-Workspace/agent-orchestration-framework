// test/mesh/worker/mesh-worker-withdraw-settle.test.mjs — the OWED lanes from m42's soak day
// (STATE.md §MISSING TESTS, 2026-07-27: "today's code shipped under fire — write
// these before/while merging"). Pins the withdraw/settle family:
//
//   1. createMeshWorkerWithdrawHandler — all three paths: the LIVE-PTY kill
//      (mark consumed by the bracket → record `cancelled`, NO terminal status
//      frame), the no-live-session DIRECT settle (the measured case), and
//      idempotence (absent / already-terminal record, a field-less frame — all
//      logged no-ops).
//   2. settleStrandedRunRecords — a stranded dir settles its running record
//      failed/runtime_offline; an absent record is a logged no-op; one entry's
//      fault never blocks the next.
//   3. The execution bracket's withdraw guards — post-settle proven
//      behaviourally (cancelled + no frame); the PRE-SPAWN consume is pinned
//      structurally (it guards a re-entry race a single-bracket harness cannot
//      produce: the mark exists only while a kill is registered).
//   4. Driver onPtyLive — kill routes to term.kill; the registries clear on
//      settle AND on the generic-catch path (late withdraw falls through to the
//      no-live-session lane both times).
//   5. reportAssignmentFailure → onLog (level warn, code preserved) and the
//      codes on previously code-less failed frames: workspace-load-failed,
//      assignment-ref-unresolved, assignment-execution-failed.
//
// Harness: the SAME fixtures the terminal-input path established — the real
// execution handler over withMeshWorkerExecFixture, the scripted PTY double with
// a captured exit lever, the status recorder for both report channels.
