// test/mesh/worker/mesh-worker-push-before-remove.test.mjs — traceability for milestone 38 /
// story 07, task 01 (01_push-before-worktree-removed.feature, ADR-015 decisions 2/3,
// invariants 3/4; @round-trip). Exercised over a REAL LOCAL BARE repo as the push
// `origin` (mesh-worker-push-fixture.mjs) + a REAL `git` spawn wrapped by a
// call-order-recording exec (createRecordingGitExec) — no mocked git, no real GitHub,
// no network. The write credential itself is proven to ride the REAL
// requestWriteCredential -> write-credential-request wire round-trip in
// mesh-worker-write-credential-pull.test.mjs; here it is supplied directly (the SAME
// "inject the resolved value, prove the wire separately" split story-01's OWN
// requestCloneCredential task tests keep between task 05's wire test and every OTHER
// task's direct-injection convenience).
