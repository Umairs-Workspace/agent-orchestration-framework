// test/mesh/worker/mesh-worker-write-credential-pull.test.mjs — traceability for milestone 38 /
// story 07 (durable-worker-pushback, ADR-015 decision 3 "mechanism"; SECURITY T15/T6).
// The write-credential PULL is the wire this story adds ALONGSIDE the ADR-009
// clone-credential PULL (mirroring it exactly, over its OWN distinct frame kind) —
// REQUIRED so the pre-existing F12 guard (acd-clone-credential-pull-not-pushed)
// stays green once `requestWriteCredential` is a "credential"-shaped collaborator
// createMeshWorkerExecutionHandler consumes (the SAME class of defect F12 exists to
// catch generalizes to any newly-added credential-shaped option, not just the
// original clone one). Every scenario is driven against the REAL
// `createWorkerStreamClient` / `requestWriteCredential` (src/worker-stream-client.mjs)
// and the REAL control-side `applyWriteCredentialRequestFrame`
// (src/control-stream-server.mjs) — the SAME authorization gates
// applyCloneCredentialRequestFrame keeps (SECURITY T6: holder, workspace-match,
// active-state) — over the house bidirectional stream fixture
// (mesh-directive-channel-fixture.mjs). No real GitHub, no network.
