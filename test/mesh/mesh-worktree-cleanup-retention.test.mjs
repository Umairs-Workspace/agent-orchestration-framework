// task 03 — a done assignment removes its worktree with `git worktree remove`, a
// failed assignment retains it for inspection, and retention is bounded by a
// documented default (milestone 35 / story 02, ADR-004). Exercised over a REAL `git
// worktree add`/`remove` in a temp fixture repo (RESEARCH.md §4 measured); the
// done/failed terminal is reached via the run-lifecycle bracketing of task 02 with an
// injected runtime spawn scripted to each outcome; retention sweeping is driven with
// an injected clock past the documented ceiling.
