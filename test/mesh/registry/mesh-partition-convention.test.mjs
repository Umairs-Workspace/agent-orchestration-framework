// Traceability wiring for milestone 22 / story 00 — the path-partition convention.
//
// Covers EVERY @executable scenario in tasks/01_path-partition-convention.feature,
// exercising the REAL src/mesh/store.mjs path seam in-process. One test object per
// @executable scenario (the Scenario-Outline folded into one entry looping the
// Examples). node:assert/strict.
//
//   01_path-partition-convention.feature — the node-record path is the single
//     node-id-keyed seam under the global partition root; the id is
//     ONE flat leaf segment directly under nodes/, never escaping into a parent or
//     nested dir; there is no aggregate nodes.json two nodes co-write; the
//     run-dimension convention equals milestone 19's runRecordPath + one <node>/
//     segment (composition demonstrated, not built); presence is a reserved shape,
//     no presence file written.
//
// CONTRACT DEFECT FLAGGED (see story STATE feedback): the Scenario-Outline's two
// traversal rows list expected-leaf "../escape.json" and "a/b.json" — values that
// CANNOT simultaneously be "one flat leaf segment directly under nodes/ that does not
// escape" (Then-steps 1+3 + the feature's prose/QA-comment). A leaf literally named
// "../escape.json" escapes nodes/; "a/b.json" nests into nodes/a/. The locked ADR-002
// INVARIANT (one node id, never a multi-segment escape) is what the seam honours: it
// coerces the id to a flat leaf, so "../escape" → "--escape.json" and "a/b" →
// "a-b.json", both directly under nodes/. The test asserts the genuine invariant for
// all rows; the two safe rows also match their literal expected-leaf.
