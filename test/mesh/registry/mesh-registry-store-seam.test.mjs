// Traceability wiring for milestone 24 / story 00 — the group-registry store + seam
// (tasks/00_registry-store-and-seam.feature).
//
// Covers EVERY @executable scenario in tasks/00_registry-store-and-seam.feature,
// exercising the REAL src/mesh/registry.mjs in-process against a temp fixture
// (mkdtemp → a workspace-shaped { workDir } → exercise → rm in finally), with an
// INJECTED config.mesh.nodeId / config.mesh.relay.controlNode pair driving the
// control-node truth table (matching → control node; mismatched → non-authority).
// No relay, no git, no credential — the dependency root, standalone. One test object
// per scenario / Scenario Outline row group. node:assert/strict.
//
//   00_registry-store-and-seam.feature — writeRegistry persists under meshDir/registry/
//     and reads back byte-equivalent (an unknown additive top-level "futureField"
//     survives); readRegistry on an absent file returns the EMPTY registry (roster [],
//     boards [], pending [], revocations []), never a throw; writeRegistry writes ONLY
//     on the control node and is a structured no-op off it (the pre-existing file
//     byte-unchanged); the write touches only meshDir/registry/ (nothing outside
//     .mesh/); the write is atomic via the writeText temp+rename seam (an interrupted
//     write leaves the prior complete registry).

// REPAIRED 2026-08-29 (milestone 59 / story 01, ADR-003 §3 — the re-arming). This suite was
// imported by `scripts/test.mjs` and never spread from `15e0a92` (2026-07-26) until this story
// turned it back on, and while it was dark the partition moved underneath it: milestone 34 /
// story 00 made the mesh home MACHINE-WIDE (`src/mesh/store.mjs`'s `meshDir` now answers
// `globalMeshPaths().meshRoot`, honouring `AOF_GLOBAL_HOME`, and takes NO workspace anchor).
// A synthetic `{ workDir }` therefore no longer decides where the registry lands, so two of
// this suite's five cases — the write-scope confinement claim and the "a non-control node
// creates nothing" claim — were asserting over a temp repo the store had stopped writing to.
//
// The repair injects the resolved `globalMeshRoot` that `loadWorkspace` supplies in
// production, which is the seam's own documented test/subprocess hook. The SCENARIOS are
// unchanged and so are their assertions: the registry still lands under `meshDir/registry/`,
// still touches nothing outside the mesh partition, and a non-control write still creates
// nothing. What changed is that the fixture now names the partition the shipped code uses.
