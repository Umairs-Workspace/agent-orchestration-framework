// Traceability wiring for milestone 22 / story 00 — the mesh-record store.
//
// Covers EVERY @executable scenario in tasks/00_mesh-record-store.feature,
// exercising the REAL src/mesh/store.mjs in-process against a temp fixture
// (mkdtemp → build a workspace-shaped { workDir } → exercise → rm in finally). One
// test object per @executable scenario. node:assert/strict.
//
//   00_mesh-record-store.feature — publishing a node record writes exactly ONE
//     nodes/<id>.json under the partition root, written atomically (writeText
//     temp+rename), and reads back byte-equivalent; the record is persisted OPAQUE
//     (unknown additive keys + nested mixed types survive byte-equivalent +
//     key-order-preserved); an absent record reads as null (not an error); two ids
//     write two files (the unaffected file byte-identical); a republish overwrites
//     the node's own file and leaves a sibling byte-identical.
