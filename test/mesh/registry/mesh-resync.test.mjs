// test/mesh/registry/mesh-resync.test.mjs — the RESYNC transport, behaviourally (m43 / story 04,
// ADR-006 + ADR-010/R4.2, owed by ADR-014/E6).
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The transport shipped with 483 lines of new node→node code and no
// behavioural test: its only exercise was two registry probes that hit `resync-no-owner`
// BEFORE any row, tick or frame existed, so `runResyncDispatchTick`, `applyResyncResultFrame`,
// `buildResyncFrame`, the worker's receive lane and the door's bounded poll were all
// unexecuted, and two of the door's codes were produced by nothing at all. The architect
// exercised the transport by hand at review and found it CORRECT — which is exactly why the
// test is owed: the behaviour is right today and nothing would tell us when it stops being.
// Model and shape: `test/mesh/mesh-recovery-push.test.mjs`, the flow this module mirrors.
//
// THE DISCIPLINE THIS MILESTONE KEEPS PAYING FOR — a green test that proves nothing. Every
// assertion below names an observable that ONLY the path under test can produce:
//   - the two failure branches BOTH write `state: "failed"`, so `failed` alone proves
//     nothing: each is pinned by its DETAIL CODE plus whether a frame left the server;
//   - the dispatched frame is pinned by its EXACT KEY SET, because "it carries no command
//     and no credential" is the property that makes this pull safe, and a frame that grew
//     one would still have the right kind;
//   - the authorization refusals are pinned by the row being BYTE-IDENTICAL afterwards
//     (state, detail AND updated_at), not merely by `applied: false` — an apply that wrote
//     and then reported failure would pass the weaker check;
//   - the door's self-owner and no-owner answers are pinned by NO REQUEST ROW EXISTING,
//     which no other branch can produce (every other answer writes one first);
//   - the resync target is pinned against an ACTIVE ASSIGNMENT TO A DIFFERENT NODE, so a
//     regression to "ask whoever it was assigned to" fails here rather than passing by
//     coincidence on a fixture where the two nodes are the same;
//   - the request-leg bound is MEASURED in virtual milliseconds off the door's own poll
//     loop and compared against the cadence it waits on — the ADR-014/E5 defect, whose
//     whole point is that the old code passed every test it had.
