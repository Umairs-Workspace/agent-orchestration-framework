// Traceability wiring for milestone 35 / story 01 — task 00
// (tasks/00_directive-down-frame.feature). Covers every @executable scenario /
// Scenario Outline row:
//   - a directive frame carries the assignment it dispatches, addressed to one node
//   - a directive reaches a node only while its connection is live (Scenario
//     Outline, 3 rows: connects / connects-then-closes / connects-then-errors)
//   - a directive reaches exactly the addressed worker and no other (Scenario
//     Outline, 2 rows: target worker-a / target worker-b)
//   - a directive to a node with no live connection is a coded refusal and sends
//     nothing
//
// Driven over the INJECTED bidirectional fake channel (test/support/
// mesh-directive-channel-fixture.mjs) — no live ws. sendDirective/
// buildDirectiveFrame are exercised directly against the SAME two-method targets
// shape createDirectiveTargetRegistry's internals expose. One additional
// end-to-end test drives the REAL startControlStreamServer + a real loopback ws +
// the real createWorkerWsTransport, proving the production wiring (not just the
// fake) carries a directive all the way to the worker client's onDirective handler.
