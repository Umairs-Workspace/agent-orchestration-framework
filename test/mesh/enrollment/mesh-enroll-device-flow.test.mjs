// Traceability wiring for milestone 24 / story 01 — task 01 (tasks/01_device-code-flow
// .feature). The relay device-flow HTTP endpoint matches a presented code, consumes it
// single-use, admits the node + issues the credential, and bounds the 10^6 space with a
// TTL check + an attempt-cap.
//
// Covers EVERY @executable scenario / Scenario Outline row, driving the endpoint
// IN-PROCESS: the REAL serveRelay (src/mesh/relay.mjs) on an ephemeral port (port: 0)
// as the control node, a real HTTP POST to /enroll via fetch (the m23 in-process relay
// pattern), the group registry seeded via story 00's writeRegistry over a temp fixture.
// issuedAt / expiresAt and the endpoint's "now" are INJECTED (a mutable clock behind a
// () => iso seam — never wall-clock, 22/R2). codeHash + relayAuth are treated as OPAQUE
// (the crypto is the security fitness's) — asserted is the durable SHAPE + the
// observable admit/reject matrix. One test object per scenario / row group.
