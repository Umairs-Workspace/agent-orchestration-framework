// Traceability wiring for milestone 38 / story 04 / task 05 —
// tasks/05_assign-targets-the-items-own-workspace.feature (@executable).
//
// ⛔ BLOCKER F21, measured LIVE at the 2026-07-24 two-machine soak: the operator
// clicked "Homedata Live Property Data" (ref 18, lark-guard-portal) and the mesh
// minted an assignment for ref 18 in the CONTROL's OWN aof workspace — an
// entirely different milestone — off a `200 ok`.
//
// ARCHITECTURE 38/ADR-012 AMENDMENT (2026-07-24), invariants 5 + 6: the wire is
// { ref, nodeId, workspaceId } with all three REQUIRED (blank/absent ⇒ coded
// `invalid-workspace`, NEVER a fallback), resolution runs through
// queryGlobalMeshStatus → status.workspaces[] → projectRoot
// (`workspace-not-found` / `workspace-not-local`), and the route ASSERTS the
// loaded workspace's OWN derived id equals the requested one BEFORE the mint
// (`workspace-id-mismatch`).
//
// EVERY lane here runs in a TWO-WORKSPACE fixture, because that is part of the
// contract and not an implementation detail: tasks 00–03 are honest producer-fed
// lanes over the REAL route, the REAL verb and the REAL store, and they could
// not see F21 — a single-workspace fixture makes the wrong answer and the right
// answer the SAME value. Both workspaces carry ref "18" (the soak's own
// collision) and BOTH have an eligible `worker-a`, so a mis-target returns a
// plausible 200 and mints, exactly as it did live.
