// Traceability wiring for milestone 04 / story 02 (loop-proof) — the two
// @executable tasks ONLY. The @uat sign-off task (02_roundtrip-signoff.feature)
// is a human gate proven later at aof:verify; it is NOT wired here.
//
// Covers EVERY @executable scenario AND every Scenario-Outline Examples row in:
//   tasks/00_validate-gates.feature — `aof work validate` accepts a clean seeded
//        stream (exit 0, no findings) and reports each defect CLASS the shipped
//        validateWork emits with a non-zero exit (folder↔frontmatter, the closed
//        tag vocabulary, the depends graph).
//   tasks/01_next-orders.feature    — `aof work next` returns the right { state,
//        ref } as the seeded stream advances: the four "ready" walks, the BLOCKED
//        edge (a held driver on an unmet depends), and the DONE edge (span out).
//
// Drives the FROZEN round-trip harness (ADR-005) — never a private copy. Each
// scenario takes a FRESH repo (createRoundTripRepo → seedSampleMilestone),
// applies ONE fixture perturbation as a file edit, then asserts the outcome via
// the re-exported shipped verbs (validateWork / nextWork) and/or the real CLI
// (`aof work validate --json`) for exit-code fidelity. Black-box: the result is a
// function of files-on-disk, not validator/traversal internals.
