// Traceability wiring for milestone 43 / story 01 (the exclusive item lock), task
//   wiki/work/43_milestone_mesh-artifact-authority/stories/01_story_item-lock/
//     tasks/00_scope-rule-one-home-faces-unchanged.feature
//
// AC1's NO-REGRESSION half: `executionScopeRef` moved DOWN out of the
// `board-mesh-execution.mjs` face into the `assignment-record.mjs` leaf, and every
// existing consumer of the rule — the continue/refine/verify door, the board's row
// overlay, run-status' streamed-run lookup — answers EXACTLY as it did at HEAD. (The
// "defined exactly once in the repo" half is a PLACEMENT invariant and lives in
// test/arch/assignment/acd-item-lock-single-door.test.mjs; it is not restated here.)
//
// TWO CHANNEL NOTES, recorded rather than papered over — both are places where the
// feature's litmus names a command surface that does not carry the field at HEAD, and
// where publishing it there would BREAK the very byte-identity this task exists to
// prove:
//
//  1. `dispatchRef` (and `scopeRef` on a LOCAL continue) live on
//     `resolveContinueDecision`'s verdict, not on `work:continue`'s envelope: the
//     running branch publishes `scopeRef` but no `dispatchRef`, and the local branch
//     publishes neither. The feature's own FEASIBILITY note names
//     `resolveContinueDecision` as where those fields are, so the decision is asserted
//     directly — it is the exported, pure function the command's `run` calls verbatim.
//     Adding the keys to the envelope would be a face change inside a task whose whole
//     contract is "not one answer moves".
//  2. `execution` on a list row rides the `mesh: true` OPT-IN (`commands/list.mjs`) —
//     the board face passes it, the CLI never does, and `acd-work-list-contract`
//     asserts the CLI's rows carry EXACTLY seven keys. So the overlay scenario is read
//     through `invoke("work:list", { mesh: true })`, which is the only channel where
//     the rule is observable at all.
