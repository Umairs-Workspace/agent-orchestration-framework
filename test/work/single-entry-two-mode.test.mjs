// Capture console.log output across an awaited call, restoring afterwards
// even on throw.
//
// `process.exitCode` IS RESTORED FOR THE SAME REASON `console.log` IS. Every call here runs a real
// CLI entry IN THIS PROCESS, and `src/cli.mjs` reports a refusal by setting `process.exitCode = 1`
// (ten sites) rather than by throwing — so a case that asserts only "the dispatch was reached"
// passes while leaving the runner's own exit code set. `scripts/test.mjs` folds a truthy
// `process.exitCode` into the run's result, which made the WHOLE 1,031-suite run exit 1 with every
// line reading `ok`: a red run with nothing red in it, and unactionable at the regression gate
// because the row it wrote carried no failure to name. Measured 2026-09-07 — `run(["graph","build"])`
// is the leaker, and it cost three whole-tree runs to attribute.
//
// The exit code is RETURNED rather than merely swallowed, so a case that wants to assert the
// refusal's exit status still can; discarding it here would trade one silent failure for another.
// This mirrors `test/command/cli-session-boot-closure.test.mjs`'s own `invoke`, which reached this
// conclusion one file earlier.
