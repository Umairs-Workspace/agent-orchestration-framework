// Traceability wiring for milestone 43 / story 01 (the exclusive item lock), task
//   wiki/work/43_milestone_mesh-artifact-authority/stories/01_story_item-lock/
//     tasks/01_lock-is-symmetric-over-execution-scope.feature
//
// AC2: an active assignment holds the WHOLE execution scope, in BOTH directions —
// running "42" locks "42/03" and running "42/03" locks "42" — while a sibling scope, a
// string-prefix near-miss ("420") and every terminal state stay free. This task varies
// the REF PAIR and holds the door constant; task 02 varies the door.
//
// THE AMBIGUITY THE FEATURE HEADER FLAGGED IS SETTLED, in the contract itself:
// ADR-010/R1.1 (cited verbatim in the story's `## Notes`) rules that the EXACT-REF
// duplicate-assign gate KEEPS `assignment-already-active` — it is HTTP-409-mapped and
// asserted twice by an m38 feature — and that only the NEW scope predicate raises
// `item-locked-by-assignment`. Row 1 of the first table is wired to that ruling, which
// is what the table already says.
//
// Every door is driven through the REAL registered command (the `invoke` house style —
// a command's `run` result IS its `--json` payload), and every refusal is cross-checked
// against the store's own row counts: a refusal that left a row behind would not be a
// lock, it would be a message.
