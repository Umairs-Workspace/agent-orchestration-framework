// Review fix (milestone 39): `aof work memory recall`'s scope dimensions are a
// deliberately duplicated two-file seam — `work-memory.mjs`'s SCOPE_FLAGS (which
// argv flags PARSE into `scope`) and `local-retrieval.mjs`'s SCOPE_FIELDS (which
// fields `applyScope` actually FILTERS on). The duplication itself is a noted
// boundary (not refactored here); this test guards it: a future scope dimension
// added to only ONE of the two lists must fail LOUDLY (a flag that parses but
// never filters, or a filterable field with no flag to set it) rather than
// half-working silently.
