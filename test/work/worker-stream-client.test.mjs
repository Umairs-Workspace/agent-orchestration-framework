// Traceability wiring for milestone 34 / story 04 — task 01
// (tasks/01_worker-stream-client.feature). Covers every @executable scenario /
// Scenario Outline row:
//   - the first frame on a connection is a full snapshot, then changes are deltas
//   - after a drop the worker reconnects and re-sends a full snapshot before deltas
//   - reconnect backoff grows then caps (Scenario Outline, 4 rows: n=1,2,3,9)
//   - a stream fault never blocks or rolls back the local work write (Scenario
//     Outline, 3 rows: connected / disconnected / throwing on send)
//
// Driven over a NET-NEW test double (the STORY.md build-note flag): an ordered frame
// recorder + a scriptable mid-stream drop/throw — a PERSISTENT, multi-frame,
// reconnecting channel distinct from mesh-relay-client.mjs's one-shot fake. An
// injected manual ticker drives the backoff schedule with zero wall-clock waits.
