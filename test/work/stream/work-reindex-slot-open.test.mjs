// Every @executable scenario (and each Scenario Outline row) below is wired
// against the LOCKED engine `reindexForInsert(workDir, { at, space, parent })`
// (src/work/reindex.mjs). Story 01 has NO command surface (STORY.md) — the
// engine is called directly via its API; the OUTCOME is read back through the
// existing, UNMODIFIED `findWork`/`listItems`/`validateWork` readers
// (src/work.mjs) against the fixture on disk — the feature's own litmus
// ("a fresh `aof work find|validate --json`").
