// task's LITMUS block names:
//   (a) THE REGENERATED OUTPUT — `renderChangelog` (src/work/upgrade.mjs), called
//       directly on a fixture registry OR on the real `WORK_ITEM_MIGRATIONS`.
//   (b) THE COMMITTED ARTIFACT ON DISK — the git-tracked `UPGRADE-CHANGELOG.md`
//       at the repo root (story 04's chosen path — see the file's own leading
//       comment / this test's `committedPath`), read directly with `fs`.
//   (c) THE `aof upgrade --dry-run --json` CLI PLAN (story 02's CLI face) — used
//       ONLY to prove the changelog never feeds back into what the engine
//       executes (the downstream-only scenario).
// No source read backs an OUTCOME assertion — every Then reads back through one
// of the three seams above.
