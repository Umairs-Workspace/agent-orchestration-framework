// Regression test for review fix 1 (milestone 41 as-built review, 2026-07-16):
// "Non-atomic insert leaves the stream corrupt on a mid-flight failure."
// `runInsertTopLevel`/`runInsertStory` (src/commands/insert-shared.mjs) used to
// call `reindexForInsert` (rename every affected folder + rewrite frontmatter)
// BEFORE scaffolding the new item — so a missing/misconfigured template threw
// `insert-template-missing` AFTER the shift, leaving the whole stream renumbered,
// no new item created, and slot P an empty gap (no rollback). The fix
// pre-flights every required template read (and the computed folder name)
// BEFORE the first mutation, mirroring the count-gate's own "gate before any
// mutation" discipline.
//
// Every scenario below is wired against the REAL registered commands
// (`work:insert-milestone` / `work:insert-story`), invoked in-process through
// the command core, and confirmed via a FRESH `listItems`/`findWork` read
// after the rejected call — no source read.
