// Every @executable scenario (and each Scenario Outline row) below is wired
// against the LOCKED engine `countShiftedByInsert(workDir, { at, space, parent })`
// (src/work/reindex.mjs), cross-checked against a fresh `listItems`/`findWork`
// read (src/work.mjs) and (for the last scenario) against
// `reindexForInsert`'s own reported shift count — the ADR-004 "one source of
// truth" guarantee.
