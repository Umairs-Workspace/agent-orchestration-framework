// verb (spawnCliSync over bin/aof.mjs, in-process registry underneath — the
// SAME face `aof migrate`/`aof project migrate` use), over a fixture project
// mixing unstamped (schema-0) and stamped (schema-1) record docs. Read back
// black-box: `aof work list --json` before/after, every record doc's on-disk
// frontmatter, `aof work validate --json`, and the command's own exit code +
// --json envelope. No source read.
