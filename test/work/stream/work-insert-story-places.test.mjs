// Every @executable scenario (and each Scenario Outline row) below is wired
// against the REAL registered command `work:insert-story`
// (src/commands/insert-story.mjs, a thin wrapper over story 01's engine via
// src/commands/insert-shared.mjs's `runInsertStory`), invoked in-process
// through the command core (src/command-core.mjs), and read back black-box via
// findWork/validateWork (src/work.mjs) — mirroring the feature's own LITMUS
// note: every Then is confirmable from the command's result envelope plus a
// FRESH find/validate read, no source read.
