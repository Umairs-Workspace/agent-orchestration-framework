// Every @executable scenario below is wired against the REAL registered command
// `work:insert-uat` (src/commands/insert-uat.mjs), invoked in-process through the
// command core. Per the feature's own LITMUS note, `depends` is NOT surfaced by
// find/list/validate, so the ONLY black-box channel for the authored value is the
// insert-uat --json envelope's `created.depends` — asserted here directly off the
// command's result. validate-green is the second, independent channel (an
// authored depends that failed to resolve would flag).
