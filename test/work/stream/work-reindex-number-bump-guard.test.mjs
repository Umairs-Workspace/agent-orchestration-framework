// Regression test for review fix 3 (milestone 41 as-built review, 2026-07-16):
// "The mandatory `number:` bump silently no-ops, committing a folder<->frontmatter
// mismatch." `reindexForInsert` (src/work/reindex.mjs) used to rename a shifted
// item's folder UNCONDITIONALLY, then guard the frontmatter `number:` write on
// `if (bumped !== text)` — so a shifted item whose record doc was malformed (no
// `---` frontmatter block at byte 0, or no `number:` line inside it) had its
// folder renamed to the NEW number while its frontmatter stayed stale at the OLD
// number: a silent validate-broken mismatch with no error. The fix asserts the
// mandatory bump actually happened BEFORE the rename commits, throwing a coded
// `reindex-number-bump-failed` error instead.
//
// Wired directly against the LOCKED engine `reindexForInsert(workDir, { at,
// space })` (mirrors work-reindex-slot-open.test.mjs's own house style — story
// 01 has no command surface), confirmed via a fresh `folderNames`/`findWork`
// read that the offending item's folder was NEVER renamed (no partial mismatch
// committed).
