// Every @executable scenario below is wired against the LOCKED engine
// `reindexForInsert(workDir, { at, space, parent })` (src/work/reindex.mjs).
// The outcome is read back via `findWork`/`validateWork` (src/work.mjs) and —
// for the exact rewritten `depends`/`parent` VALUE, which find/list --json do
// not expose — by reading the referencing item's record-doc frontmatter line
// directly, exactly as the feature's own litmus prescribes.
