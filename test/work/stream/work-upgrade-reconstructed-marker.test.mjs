// injectable `migrations` seam (runUpgrade/planUpgrade's `{ migrations }`
// option, src/work/upgrade.mjs) — a SYNTHETIC reconstructing transform drives
// expressibility (ADR-008); the real 0->1 stamp transform is exercised
// separately to prove it sets NO marker and transforms shape only. No
// backfill is performed — the real WORK_ITEM_MIGRATIONS declares no
// reconstructing transform, asserted directly here too. No source read.
