// Traceability wiring for milestone 43 / story 01 (the exclusive item lock), task
//   wiki/work/43_milestone_mesh-artifact-authority/stories/01_story_item-lock/
//     tasks/05_operator-refused-automatic-skipped-and-counted.feature
//
// AC7: ONE predicate, TWO renderings, and the choice between them is decided once —
// inside the lock — rather than at each call site. An OPERATOR VERB (a mint, a second
// assignment, a control-side mutation) is refused: coded, loud, non-zero. An AUTOMATIC
// PERIODIC TICK (the control's publish, ADR-004) skips the rows it does not own, COUNTS
// the skips in its own result, and emits no refusal at all — a coded refusal per held
// item per tick is log spam, and the tick asked nothing.
//
// THE TICK'S CHANNEL. `publishGlobalWorkSnapshot` IS the tick's body: the control
// launcher's `capturePropagation` (mesh-launcher.mjs) calls exactly this and nothing
// else, so driving it drives the tick without standing a daemon up. Its result is the
// envelope the launcher reports.
//
// THE COUNTER IS ADDITIVE AND DISTINCT (ADR-010/D1a): `publishWorkspaceSnapshot` has
// always returned `skipped: items.errors.length` — a PROJECTION-ERROR count. The
// held-skip counter is `heldSkipped`, with `heldRefs` beside it so the count is
// explainable, and it is never summed into `skipped`.
