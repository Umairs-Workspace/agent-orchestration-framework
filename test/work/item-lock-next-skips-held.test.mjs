// Traceability wiring for milestone 43 / story 01 (the exclusive item lock), task
//   wiki/work/43_milestone_mesh-artifact-authority/stories/01_story_item-lock/
//     tasks/04_next-skips-held-items-and-reports-the-holder.feature
//
// AC6: `work next` consults the SAME predicate the mint door does and renders it the
// other way round — it returns the next UNHELD item and REPORTS the ones it stepped
// over, each naming its holder. The two failure modes the criterion names are both
// closed: an item is never silently omitted (invisible), and never handed out to be
// refused a step later (a bad seam).
//
// The envelope is the additive shape ADR-010/R1.5 pins: `skipped: [{ ref, scopeRef,
// holderNode, assignmentId, state }]` — the same five facts the refusal payload carries
// — plus the new state `held`, explicitly NOT `done`.
//
// ONE FIXTURE DIVERGENCE, recorded rather than papered over. The last scenario ("an
// item stops being skipped the moment its assignment settles") requires `work next` to
// return "42" itself once the lock releases. Under `nextWork`'s pre-existing drill-down
// (untouched by this story), a not-started milestone WITH not-started stories resolves
// to its first story, never to itself — so that scenario is exercised over a
// story-less "42", the minimal stream in which its own Then can be true. Every other
// scenario uses the Background stream verbatim.
