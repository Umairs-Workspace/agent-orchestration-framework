// Traceability wiring for milestone 43 / story 01 (the exclusive item lock), task
//   wiki/work/43_milestone_mesh-artifact-authority/stories/01_story_item-lock/
//     tasks/02_one-coded-refusal-at-every-door.feature
//
// AC3 + AC5: every door onto a held item — a second assignment, a local `run-start`, a
// `run-retry`, and a control-side mutation (an insert, which RENUMBERS FOLDERS while a
// worker holds a worktree full of the old refs) — refuses with the same code and the
// same five-key payload, minting nothing and renaming nothing, and all of them open
// again at the gate. This task varies the DOOR; task 01 varies the ref pair.
//
// NOT ASSERTED HERE: that the check sits INSIDE `transitionRunStart` rather than at its
// five call sites. That is a PLACEMENT invariant and lives in
// test/arch/assignment/acd-item-lock-single-door.test.mjs.
//
// ONE ROW IS RULED, NOT CHOSEN. The headline table's "a second assignment, scope ref"
// row carries the feature's own NOTE: it is the one contested code, and if the
// architect keeps the exact-ref gate first it reports `assignment-already-active` and
// moves to task 01's table. ADR-010/R1.1 (quoted in the story's `## Notes`) ruled
// exactly that, so the row is wired to `assignment-already-active` here and its
// scope-lock twin lives in task 01.
//
// The three scenarios that assert a PROCESS EXIT STATUS and a stderr render drive the
// REAL `aof` CLI as a child process (the work-insert-cli-confirm-envelope harness);
// everything else goes in-process through the registry, where a command's `run` result
// IS the `--json` payload.
