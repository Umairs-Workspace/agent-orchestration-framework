// Traceability wiring for story 31 `migrate-claude-command` — the /aof:migrate
// bundle command (the INFERENCE CEILING over the story-29 mechanical CLI).
//
// Covered here:
//   tasks/00_command-body-cli-first-handoff.feature — the two @executable
//        content/shape pins over the AUTHORED body `src/bundle/commands/migrate.md`
//        (grep-able marker facts + character-offset ordering, the proven
//        acd-doctor-validate-keystone idiom). The AUTHORED file is asserted, not
//        the render (the renderer re-emits frontmatter and injects aof-invocation —
//        already covered by the derived arch-tests).
//   tasks/03_bundle-distribution-and-nonregression.feature — every scenario +
//        every Examples row: the descriptor member, the derived-manifest
//        byte-for-byte regeneration (ADR-002), the `aof work update` landing, and
//        the install-state × invocation matrix (never-inited refusal, init landing,
//        idempotent re-run, dry-run pending render, ADR-005 drift preserved /
//        --force restored) — all via the SAME engine seams work-update.test.mjs /
//        work-init.test.mjs use (updateWork bundleOverride, installBase).
//
// Tasks 01/02 are @manual (agent-run at aof:verify): their contract lives IN the
// command body; the hardening pins below keep the body's statements of those
// contracts from silently regressing, but the passes themselves are not run here.
