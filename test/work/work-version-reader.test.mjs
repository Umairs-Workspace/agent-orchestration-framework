// Traceability wiring for milestone 40 / story 01 (version stamp & reader), task
//   wiki/work/40_milestone_work-item-versioning-upgrade/stories/
//     01_story_version-stamp-and-reader/tasks/00_reader-schema-and-provenance.feature
// Every @executable scenario (and each Scenario Outline row) below is wired
// against the LOCKED reader seam — `readItemSchema`/`readItemVersion`
// (src/work.mjs, ADR-001/ADR-003) — and the exported `WORK_ITEM_SCHEMA_VERSION`
// constant, read back over a hand-authored fixture on disk, cross-checked
// against a fresh `parseFrontmatter` call proving the shared parser is
// UNCHANGED (18/ADR-007): it hands back the raw scalar, never a coerced value —
// the reader's coercion is the reader's job, not the parser's.
