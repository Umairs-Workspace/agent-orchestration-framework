// Traceability wiring for milestone 43 / story 01 (the exclusive item lock), task
//   wiki/work/43_milestone_mesh-artifact-authority/stories/01_story_item-lock/
//     tasks/03_holder-admitted-by-identity-never-exemption.feature
//
// AC4 (+ AC8's behavioural residue): the guard ADMITS the holder by IDENTITY, never by
// exemption. A mint made UNDER an assignment carries that assignment's id and is
// admitted; a mint naming a DIFFERENT, a STALE (settled) or an UNKNOWN-but-recorded one
// is refused, as is a mint carrying none while a foreign assignment holds the scope.
// There is no "worker is exempt" branch and no operator flag that could become one.
//
// THE ALTITUDE, stated rather than implied. The feature's own FEASIBILITY note pins it:
// "there is deliberately NO operator command that passes an assignment identity to a
// mint; the only carriers are the worker's own dispatch sites … so the identity matrix
// below is driven through the DISPATCH, not through a flag". So the matrix is driven at
// the seam the worker's two mint sites call, with the SAME edge and the SAME
// `opts.lock` those sites pass (`mesh-worker-execution.mjs`), and the no-identity row —
// the one an operator can drive by hand — goes through the real `work:run-start`.
//
// RECORDED, not hidden (ADR-010 / FEASIBILITY §6.4): "admitted by identity" is vacuous
// CROSS-MACHINE — `global_assignments` is control-only, and a worker is admitted by an
// empty store. The terminal-id row below is therefore in-process-only, and the
// cross-machine proof is task 06's `@manual` soak.
