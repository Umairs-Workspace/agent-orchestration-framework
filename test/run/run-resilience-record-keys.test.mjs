//
//   00_resilience-record-keys.feature — the run record is extended with the four
//     additive resilience keys (failureReason / heartbeatAt / retryOf /
//     reclaimedAt): present + null on a fresh start, exactly the thirteen frozen
//     keys and no others, a legacy nine-key record reads each missing key as null,
//     populated keys round-trip byte-equivalent across a fresh load, each key is
//     set only by its owning mechanic, completing-as-failed records the supplied
//     reason (done/cancelled record null), and an unrecognised reason is recorded
//     verbatim (the classifier fails closed on it, the store never rejects it).
