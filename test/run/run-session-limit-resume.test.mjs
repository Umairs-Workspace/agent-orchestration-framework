// Traceability wiring for 348 auto-resume — the session-limit park gate and the
// deterministic re-entry face (work:resume).
//
// WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS. On vista-app milestone 348 three API session limits cost
// 6h18m of dead run. The vocabulary had no word for that failure, so every kill was
// recorded as `runtime_offline`: retryable, but carrying no reset time, so nothing
// could distinguish "retry now" from "retry at 1:10am" and nothing could tell an
// operator what was waiting to come back. These tests pin the three properties that
// close it — the reason is FIRST CLASS, the record carries WHEN, and a retry before
// then is REFUSED rather than burning an attempt into a still-limited window.
//
// Exercises the REAL store + the REAL in-process registry against temp fixture repos
// (mkdtemp → build → run → rm in finally). The clock is INJECTED everywhere (`now`),
// never read, so nothing here is time-of-day flaky.
