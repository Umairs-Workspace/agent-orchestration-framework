// the illegal-transition matrix are asserted cell-by-cell (Scenario-Outline rows
// folded into one entry each). node:assert/strict.
//
//   01_state-machine.feature — the validator accepts only the five legal edges of
//     the closed table; a legal terminal transition records state + outcome==state
//     and bumps updatedAt; an illegal transition is rejected with illegal-transition
//     and the stored record is BYTE-UNCHANGED; starting a run always yields running.
