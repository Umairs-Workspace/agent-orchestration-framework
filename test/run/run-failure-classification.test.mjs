// Traceability wiring for milestone 20 / story 00 — failure classification.
//
// Covers EVERY @executable scenario in
//   tasks/01_failure-classification.feature
// exercising the REAL pure functions of src/run-store.mjs in-process. The closed
// classification table and the shouldRetry ceiling matrix are asserted row-by-row
// (Scenario-Outline rows folded into one entry each). node:assert/strict.
//
//   01_failure-classification.feature — isRetryable evaluates failureReason against
//     ONE closed table (runtime_offline/timeout → retryable; agent_error/unknown/
//     null → fail closed); shouldRetry ANDs that verdict with the attempt ceiling
//     (true iff retryable AND attempt < maxAttempts, fails closed at the ceiling);
//     the ceiling is the supplied maxAttempts, not a constant; classification is
//     referentially transparent (same inputs → same verdict, no mutation).
