// THE GRAPH SUITES — this directory's index, and the ONE place its membership is
// written down (119/03, ADR-010). The registry names directories; a directory names its own
// suites. A new suite here is one import and one spread IN THIS FILE, and `scripts/test.mjs`
// is unchanged by its arrival.
//
// Membership is IMPORTED AND SPREAD, never derived: no `readdir` decides what belongs here.
// `registrationDecision` (`src/work-audit/census.mjs`) stays the single decider of which file
// contributed which entries, and this file is one of its inputs rather than a second answer.
// Every binding the registry spread for a suite is spread here — including both of the two
// that four suites in this tree export, which a one-binding-per-file index would halve.
