// graph:build failure propagation, driven END-TO-END through the REAL resolver
// and the REAL spawn — no injected seams. A fake graphify binary is planted in a
// temp managed store (the AOF_GLOBAL_HOME seam), so these scenarios exercise the
// full chain invoke("graph:build") → resolveGraphifyBinary (store-first, keyed on
// PINNED_GRAPHIFY_VERSION) → spawnSync → the status/persist classification — the
// exact chain the field incident travelled (PantraWeb, 2026-08-07: `aof graph
// build src` with no src/ reported "Built 3149 nodes" — graphify exited 1 with
// "error: path not found" on stderr while the driver read the PREVIOUS graph.json
// and presented its counts as a fresh build).
//
// The unit-level classification is covered by graph-command-core's injected-seam
// scenarios; what THIS suite pins is different:
//   - the store-first pin is load-bearing: the fake store binary is spawned even
//     though a real graphify may sit on PATH (the distinctive stderr proves which
//     binary ran) — a store key drifting from PINNED_GRAPHIFY_VERSION would make
//     these tests fall through to the PATH binary and fail loudly;
//   - a non-zero exit from the REAL spawn layer surfaces as the structured
//     `graphify-build-failed` carrying graphify's own stderr, never as a
//     successful BuildResult over the stale artifact;
//   - a zero exit still succeeds, deriving counts from graph.json.
