// Traceability wiring for milestone 10 / story 01 (graph-grounded-reranking),
// task 00 — 00_graph-reranks-by-file-relatedness.feature.
//
// Covers EVERY @executable scenario AND every Scenario-Outline Examples row of that
// feature, driving the FROZEN pure re-ranker `rerank(records, normalizedGraph, query,
// scope, opts)` (../src/memory/graphify-backend.mjs) directly over the COMMITTED,
// hand-authored fixtures — NO live binary, NO spawn, NO normalizeGraph round-trip:
//   tasks/fixtures/reranking-records.json           (frozen 05/ADR-005 MemoryRecords)
//   tasks/fixtures/reranking-graph.normalized.json  (the 09/ADR-003 normalized graph)
//
// The deterministic reordering the fixtures encode (feature Background + NOTE):
//   base order (graph absent): ISOLATED, RELATED, CENTRAL, CENTRAL_TWO  (4-way tie,
//                              broken by stable fixture order — ISOLATED wins)
//   re-ranked order:           CENTRAL, CENTRAL_TWO, RELATED, ISOLATED  (graph flips
//                              the isolated file to LAST, the central file to #1)
//
// This feature pins ONLY observable ranked ORDER, set-equality, and field-presence —
// the structural invariants (no graphify.mjs/child_process import; records from the 05
// parsers; never graph-id-keyed) are story-03 arch-tests, not Then-lines here.
