Feature: Command spine — one route table, one face, one envelope
  The registry is the single source of truth for every verb (m42 wave (d) leg d1):
  a command carrying cli.route dispatches through the registry-derived route table
  into the ONE generic face, with its flag vocabulary declared on itself, one
  structured error envelope under --json, and one exit-code policy. These
  scenarios are the CONTRACT every migrated verb inherits — a new migration gets
  covered by adding a scenario here, not by hand-rolling a face.

  Scenario: a registry-routed work verb dispatches through the generic face
    Given a work stream with milestone "03" titled "Board"
    When I run `work doc 03 SPEC --json`
    Then the command should succeed
    And the JSON result field "present" should be true
    And the JSON result field "doc" should be "SPEC"

  Scenario: a migrated group verb keeps its human rendering byte-for-byte
    Given a work stream with milestone "03" titled "Board"
    When I run `assets list`
    Then the command should succeed
    And stdout should contain `resources: 0`

  Scenario: a migrated verb answers --json with the command result verbatim
    Given a work stream with milestone "03" titled "Board"
    When I run `project show --json`
    Then the command should succeed
    And the JSON result field "name" should be "fixture"

  Scenario: an undeclared flag is refused loudly, never silently absorbed
    Given a work stream with milestone "03" titled "Board"
    When I run `assets list --bogus`
    Then the command should fail
    And stderr should contain `Unknown flag "--bogus"`

  Scenario: a command failure under --json is one structured envelope on stdout
    Given a work stream with milestone "03" titled "Board"
    When I run `work run-complete 99 --outcome done --json`
    Then the command should fail
    And the JSON error envelope should carry code "ref-not-found"

  Scenario: input-contract failures are coded and precede any write
    Given a work stream with milestone "03" titled "Board"
    And story "03/01" titled "Board UI"
    When I run `work run-complete 03/01 --outcome bogus --json`
    Then the command should fail
    And the JSON error envelope should carry code "invalid-outcome"

  Scenario: a non-json failure propagates to stderr with a non-zero exit
    Given a work stream with milestone "03" titled "Board"
    When I run `work doc 03 NONSENSE`
    Then the command should fail
    And stderr should contain `Unknown document "NONSENSE"`

  Scenario: a routed nested mesh verb refuses bad input with the one envelope

  Scenario: a launcher verb's --json is the non-blocking probe, never the daemon
    Given a work stream with milestone "03" titled "Board"
    When I run `mesh serve --serve --json`
    Then the command should succeed
    And the JSON result field "launcherRunning" should be false

  Scenario: a launcher verb registered on the seam answers --json with its probe
    Given a work stream with milestone "03" titled "Board"
    When I run `mesh ui --json`
    Then the command should succeed
    And the JSON result field "scope" should be "global"
    And the JSON result field "relayConfigured" should be false

  Scenario: every launcher family answers --json with its non-blocking probe
    Given a work stream with milestone "03" titled "Board"
    When I run `graph serve --json`
    Then the command should succeed
    And the JSON result field "mode" should be "mcp-stdio"
    When I run `work ui --json`
    Then the command should succeed

    Given a work stream with milestone "03" titled "Board"
    When I run `mesh desktop install --json`
    Then the command should fail
    And the JSON error envelope should carry code "app-artifact-missing"

  Scenario: the desktop no-verb shim still owns the refusal a route cannot express
    Given a work stream with milestone "03" titled "Board"
    When I run `mesh desktop --json`
    Then the command should fail
    And the JSON error envelope should carry code "invalid-input"

  Scenario: a routed read keeps its bare-array --json document and read-miss exit split
    Given a work stream with milestone "03" titled "Board"
    When I run `work find 03 --json`
    Then the command should succeed
    And stdout should contain `"ref": "03"`
    When I run `work find nothing-matches --json`
    Then the command should succeed
    And stdout should contain `[]`
    When I run `work find nothing-matches`
    Then the command should fail
    And stdout should contain `No work item matches "nothing-matches".`

  Scenario: a CLI-only config verb rides the route table with one json document

    When I run `work use-headroom --json`
    Then the command should succeed
    And stdout should contain `configPath`
