// TECH_DEBT item 1 — build-info: which code is this process actually running?
// The seam behind `aof --version`'s "(payload <id>)" suffix and the daemons'
// startup "Build:" line. Pins:
//   - outside a SEA the mode is ALWAYS "source" (env stamps are ignored — a
//     stray AOF_RUNTIME_MODE can never make a repo run claim to be an install)
//   - inside a SEA, sea-entry's AOF_RUNTIME_MODE stamp decides payload/embedded,
//     defaulting to "embedded" (a pre-launcher binary runs its embedded bundle)
//   - BUILD_ID.json beside the exe is read tolerantly: absent/corrupt is the
//     honest "no build stamp", never a throw and never a fabricated id
