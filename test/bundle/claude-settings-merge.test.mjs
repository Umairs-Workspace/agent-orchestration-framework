// milestone 43 / story 03 — task 03: the CO-AUTHORED `.claude/settings.json`
// (`tasks/03_claude-settings-surgical-merge.feature`, AC9–AC12, ADR-002).
//
// A HARD RULE, AND THE FIXTURE THAT KEEPS IT: every scenario runs against the
// operator-owned projection of the real `.claude/settings.json`, in a scratch directory.
// NOTHING here writes to the repo's own file — it is this repo's live hook config
// (SessionStart / UserPromptSubmit / SessionEnd session wiring plus the PreToolUse
// test-isolation guard), and the whole story exists because a latent defect would
// delete it. The file is read once from disk and aof-marked groups are projected out,
// so the fixture is the operator's real key set rather than someone's memory of it.
//
// EVERY `Then` is confirmable from the settings FILE's own bytes before and after a
// run — its parsed content, its byte-for-byte comparison against the prior copy, its
// mtime — plus the `--json` plan envelope of the command that ran. The invariant "the
// settings writer never writes the file wholesale" is a property of every possible run
// and belongs to `test/arch/bundle/acd-claude-settings-co-authored.test.mjs`; what is asserted
// here is its observable consequence.
//
// BYTE-IDENTICAL, READ AS THE PRECEDENTS DEFINE IT. ADR-002 names `mergeLock` and
// `writeSidecarPatch` as the shape to mirror, and both re-serialise the whole document
// with `JSON.stringify(_, null, 2)`; `mergeLock`'s own comment says keys the patch does
// not name "survive byte-equivalent". So a surviving key is compared by its canonical
// serialisation — every operator VALUE intact, nothing dropped, nothing invented.
// (A merge that changes nothing writes nothing at all, so an untouched file is never
// even re-serialised.)
//
// The `@manual` scenario at the foot of the feature (a scratch CLONE of this repo,
// with a real `claude` session started in it) is not agent-runnable in one process and
// is NOT attempted here.
