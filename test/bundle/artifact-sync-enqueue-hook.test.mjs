// milestone 43 / story 03 — task 00: the PostToolUse ENQUEUE hook
// (`tasks/00_posttooluse-enqueue-hook.feature`, AC1–AC4, ADR-001).
//
// THE THREE CHANNELS the contract's litmus allows, and the only ones used here:
//   (a) the QUEUE FILE's bytes after a payload is delivered on stdin,
//   (b) the process's EXIT CODE and its stdout/stderr as the harness observed them,
//   (c) the `hooks.PostToolUse` entry as it stands in the WRITTEN settings file.
// No source read of the enqueue script: this suite asserts what the script DOES.
// The structural half ("no src/ import, no store open, no workspace-identity
// derivation, no non-zero exit path") is a property of every possible run and is owned
// by `test/arch/bundle/acd-artifact-sync-hook-derivation-free.test.mjs`.
//
// EVERY RUN SPAWNS THE REAL SCRIPT with argv and JSON on stdin — no shell string, no
// `bash -c`, no heredoc — so these steps run unchanged on the Windows control node,
// the Mac worker and the WSL worker. The two degrade conditions that are not portably
// provokable (ENOSPC, a permission-denied directory) are deliberately absent; their
// portable stand-ins (an absent parent, a directory named as the queue, a file as the
// parent) are in the table and reach the same "the append throws" branch.
//
// The `@manual` scenario at the foot of the feature (the exec entry spawning
// identically on all three nodes) needs three machines and is NOT attempted here.
