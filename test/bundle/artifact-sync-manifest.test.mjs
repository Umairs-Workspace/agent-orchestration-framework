// milestone 43 / story 03 — task 02: the ARTIFACT SET
// (`tasks/02_artifact-manifest-widening-and-content-hash.feature`, AC6–AC8, ADR-007).
//
// The set becomes a bounded TWO-KIND manifest — `{name,file}` × 8 exact filenames and
// `{name,dir,ext}` × `tasks/` + `.feature` — with no glob language; `WORK_ITEM_DOC_FILES`
// is DERIVED from it; and every artifact travels with a content hash so an unchanged one
// is never re-sent.
//
// Everything below is observed from the OUTSIDE: the control node's answers to the real
// `work:doc` / `work:tasks` commands after a real worker tick, the artifact rows'
// `updatedAt` stamps (an artifact NOT re-sent is a stamp that did not move), and the
// artifact list a tick's frame carries. This suite never asserts that the manifest is
// "one constant in one module" — that sameness property belongs to
// `test/arch/work/acd-work-artifact-set-single-home.test.mjs`.
