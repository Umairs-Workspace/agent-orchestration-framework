// milestone 43 / story 03 — task 01: the DRAIN
// (`tasks/01_daemon-drains-queue-into-one-batched-frame.feature`, AC5, ADR-001).
//
// Every scenario drives the REAL worker daemon: `startLauncher` with an injected
// `streamSyncTicker` and a fake transport, firing the production `pushStreamSnapshot`
// (mesh-launcher.mjs). There is no "drain seam" being tested in isolation — the drain,
// the reconciliation read, the content hash and the frame all run exactly as they do
// on a worker, and the CONTROL side answers through the real `work:doc` / `work:tasks`
// commands after the real `applyWorktreeContentFrame` door has admitted the frame.
//
// THE FOUR CHANNELS the contract's litmus allows:
//   (a) the batched frame on the wire (which artifacts, how many frames per tick),
//   (b) the control node's answers through `work doc` / `work tasks`,
//   (c) the control row's own `updatedAt` / `reportedBy` (a row NOT re-sent is
//       observable as a stamp that did not move),
//   (d) `aof mesh logs --node <worker> --json`, run for REAL against the control's
//       node_logs ring. The fixture forwards each launcher warning through the exact
//       mapping `mesh serve` uses (commands/mesh-serve.mjs:58-65) and lands it with the
//       control's own `applyLogEntriesFrame`, so a degrade assertion is made on the
//       channel the contract names rather than one hop short of it.
//
// The `@uat` scenario at the foot of the feature (an operator reading a live remote
// agent's freshly authored features mid-run) is a human gate at the milestone verify
// and is NOT attempted here.
