// Traceability wiring for milestone 28 / story 01 (signing-notarization) —
// craft-review F3 (HIGH): install.sh's pinned GPG fingerprint was previously
// unverifiable against the actual CI signing key — a one-byte drift means
// every Linux install refuses forever (install.sh's Build note F2
// untrusted/unpinned-key refusal). This drives the REAL
// scripts/release/assert-fingerprint-pin.mjs over REAL gpg keypairs (no
// stubs) against three crafted install.sh fixtures:
//   - a MATCH: install.sh's embedded key + AOF_RELEASE_GPG_FINGERPRINT agree
//     with EACH OTHER and with the CI-imported key -> passes cleanly.
//   - a SELF-INCONSISTENT install.sh: the embedded key's own fingerprint
//     disagrees with the AOF_RELEASE_GPG_FINGERPRINT variable (install.sh's
//     ACTUAL runtime trust gate) -> a distinct, clearly-labelled failure.
//   - a CI-KEY MISMATCH: install.sh is internally consistent, but pins a
//     DIFFERENT key than the one actually imported into the CI keyring (the
//     literal F3 lockout scenario) -> a distinct, clearly-labelled failure.
//
// Reuses the shared WSL-launcher-excluding gpg resolver (test/installer-shell.mjs)
// so this test is not subject to the same PATH-order gpg-resolution trap the
// coordinator already hardened the installer tests against.
