// Craft-review hardening for milestone 28 / story 00's SEA build recipe
// (scripts/build-sea.mjs) — two build-script UNIT tests, neither requiring a
// real build/exec:
//
//   F14 — assertSafeOutDir refuses a --out that resolves to the repo root, the
//   cwd, or a directory carrying package.json/src (a workspace marker), so
//   `--out .` (or an alias of the repo root) can never rmSync the working tree.
//
//   F8 — planMacCodesignSteps returns the ordered codesign --remove-signature
//   (before postject) / codesign --sign - (after postject) step list ONLY on
//   darwin; it is a pure planner (no execFileSync call), so its OUTPUT is
//   assertable on this (non-darwin) box without invoking the real codesign
//   binary. The mac EXECUTION of these steps is an @manual CI/verify row.
