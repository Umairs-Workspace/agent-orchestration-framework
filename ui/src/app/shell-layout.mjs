// The SHELL'S LAYOUT MODEL (milestone 45 / story 03; ARCHITECTURE ADR-005 with its five
// [Build-N] amendments, DESIGN §"The shell's layout primitives", §Surface 1's binding
// checklist, §The chrome budget, DG-45-1 and DG-45-2).
//
// Framework-free by contract, exactly as ui/src/app/routes.mjs is: no React, no DOM, no
// `window`, no clock. This repo has NO React test harness for layout decisions, so a shell
// that kept its regions, its stacking rungs and its fullscreen transitions inside JSX would
// keep the one set of decisions milestones 46 and 49 bind to in the one place nothing can
// check. `test/arch/mesh/acd-shell-z-ladder-single-home.test.mjs` imports this module under plain
// `node` — that import IS the first assertion, and it is why every DOM-shaped concern
// (adopting a live node into the overlay, moving focus, measuring a rail) lives in
// ui/src/app/Shell.tsx and never here.
//
// WHAT THIS MODULE IS FOR, stated once. Three downstream milestones consume it:
//   - m46 unifies the terminal control and needs a BOX whose height is knowable without
//     measuring the document, a rung for its dock, and one fullscreen door;
//   - m47 adds a repo filter beside the scope control and needs the surface SLOT;
//   - m49 puts a grid of live terminals at "/" and needs all of the above at once.
// So every export below is a name one of them binds to, and nothing here is decoration.
//
// Driven headlessly by test/ui/shell-regions.test.mjs and
// test/ui/shell-not-found-and-fullscreen.test.mjs — and, for the dock's region home, its inset and
// the arithmetic that follows from them, by test/ui/shell-dock-region.test.mjs and
// test/ui/shell-dock-inset-and-clamp.test.mjs (m46/05).

// The SLOT NAMES are the bus's, imported rather than retyped — WHICH region a slot lands in is
// a layout fact and belongs here, but the NAME of the slot has one home and it is the channel
// that carries it. The edge runs layout → bus and never back: the bus imports nothing.

//
// [Build-4] — THREE exported region constants, FIVE visual rows. DESIGN draws five rows
// (notice rail, top bar, surface bar, content, overlay) and ADR-005 names three regions:
// R1–R3 are INTERIOR STRUCTURE of `chrome` (all three sit above the content region, all
// three are summed into the published chrome height, two of the three are conditional),
// R4 is `content` and R5 is `overlay`. A module exporting five would put `noticeRail` and
// `surfaceBar` into the vocabulary of every downstream milestone, and 46, 47 and 49 would
// each have to know which of the five exist in a given viewport state. Three names are true
// in every state.

// region is the FOURTH row in every combination, so its position never depends on what is
// present above it. The overlay is out of flow and contributes zero to the height of
// anything — which is what lets a fullscreen occupant cover the chrome without a stacking

// two homes — one in this module (which the budget, the published chrome height and every
// downstream milestone read) and one in Shell.tsx's JSX (which is what the operator actually
// sees) — free to disagree with nobody noticing. `test/ui/shell-regions.test.mjs` asserts the

// "the chip keeps its right-edge anchor so nothing moves at the threshold").
//
// WHY THIS IS A CONSTANT AND NOT TWO COPIES OF A CLASS STRING (designer GAP-4, measured at the
// `aof:verify 45` end gate). The chip shipped as `min-w-[7ch]` on both elements — which LOOKS
// like it reserves seven characters and does not. Tailwind sets `box-sizing: border-box`, so a
// `min-width` is a BORDER-box minimum: subtract `px-2` (16px) and the border (2px) and
// `min-w-[7ch]` reserves 7ch − 18px of TEXT room. Measured in the shipped bundle: 1ch = 6.609px,
// so the reservation was 46.184px total = 28.18px of text ≈ **4.26 characters**. An identity of
// five or more grew the box and took the nav with it — `fleet` measured 51px against the
// placeholder's 46.184px, a 4.8px jump at the moment the identity resolved. The prose and the
// class disagreed, and the class is what shipped.
//
// `calc(7ch + 1.125rem)` adds back the 16px of padding and the 2px of border, so the
// reservation is what it says: seven characters of TEXT. `max-w-[18ch]` is left as-is — it is a
// truncation ceiling, not an anchor, and `truncate` handles the overflow.
//
// The class is a LITERAL, never composed from the numbers below. Tailwind generates utilities by
// scanning source text for class strings, so a template-interpolated `min-w-[calc(...)]` would

// parent that has no definite height in `content:page`, and the wrapper collapses to its
// content. `calc(100dvh - var(--aof-shell-chrome-height, 0px))` is a definite height in every

//      so `--aof-shell-chrome-height` grows by the rail's measured height and every surface
//      sizing against it stays correct straight through the breach;
//   2. the VERDICT is judged on the content floor (>= 432px at the desktop window's height),
//      which is the number the budget exists to protect — a rail that pushes content below
//      it is a breach even though the bars are within their cap;
//   3. nothing yields to the rail (m38's DG-20 lesson: an element that disappears only when
//      a condition happens to be true makes its own absence a second, accidental signal for
//      that condition);
//   4. the rail is bounded — one notice, 25% of the viewport height — which is what stops
//      the exemption running away.
//
// AND THE DOCK INSET RIDES BESIDE IT (m46/DG-46-1), as a SECOND published number that is
// INDEPENDENT of the first in both directions:
//   · the dock is out of flow, so opening, dragging, collapsing and closing it change the
//     published chrome height by NOTHING and can never move the shell into or out of a chrome
//     breach — the verdict below is judged on `contentHeight`, which the inset does not touch;
//   · the inset is MEASURED, exactly as the rail's height is — content-driven, an INPUT to this
//     model, never a number the model invents. A COLLAPSED dock is a steady state whose header
//     still paints over the content region, so it publishes its measured header height; ZERO is
//     reserved for a dock that is genuinely ABSENT (never opened, or closed with ✕). Reserving a
