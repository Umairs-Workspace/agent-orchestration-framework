// THE APP SHELL (milestone 45 / story 03; ADR-002 and ADR-005 with its five [Build-N]
// amendments; DESIGN §Surface 1's binding checklist).
//
// The chrome the four routed surfaces mount inside. It renders DESIGN's five rows in one
// declared order — R1 notice rail, R2 top bar, R3 surface bar, R4 content (the ONE `<main>`
// and the one mount point), R5 overlay — publishes the measured chrome height as one CSS
// custom property, and owns the navigation, the not-found state and the single fullscreen
// door.
//
// WHAT IS *NOT* HERE, ON PURPOSE. Every decision this file makes is read from
// ui/src/app/shell-layout.mjs and ui/src/app/shell-nav.mjs — the region order and heights, the
// chrome-height model and its budget verdict, the content modes, the z ladder, the nav items
// and their hrefs, the fullscreen transitions. This component contributes the DOM and nothing
// else. That split is not tidiness: this repo has no React test harness for layout decisions,
// so a rule that lives in JSX is a rule nothing can check, and milestones 46/47/49 all bind to
// those modules by name.
//
// WHAT IS ONLY HERE, ALSO ON PURPOSE ([Build-1]). Presenting a surface fullscreen ADOPTS a
// LIVE DOM NODE — the shell re-parents it into a dedicated, React-childless host inside the
// overlay region, and returns the SAME node to its home on dismiss. It never renders a copy of
// one. The tidy-looking build (render a React
// element into an overlay portal) unmounts and remounts the subtree, so a terminal's session
// effect cleans up — `dataSub.dispose()`, `socket.close()`, `term.dispose()` — and fullscreen
// becomes the one gesture that kills the session it exists to enlarge. Reviewers: this is the
// adoption ADR-005's Consequences tell you to look for.
