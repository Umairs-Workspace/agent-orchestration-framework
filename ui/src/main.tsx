// THE APPLICATION ENTRY (milestone 45 / story 03; ADR-001, ADR-002, ADR-003).
//
// Three acts and nothing else: mount, apply the legacy `?mode=` translation ONCE, and render
// the shell around the surface the ONE route table names. It was 1,267 lines until this
// milestone, because it was both the entry and the config editor — the render root was its
// last six lines and `<App>` was the other 1,260. `<App>` now lives at ui/src/config/App.tsx,
// its route's own name, and `test/arch/acd-ui-single-route-table.test.mjs` keeps it there: the
// entry IMPORTS surfaces and defines none.
//
// It keeps its name and its location because index.html hardcodes `/src/main.tsx`.
// `import "./index.css"` STAYS HERE: it is the global stylesheet for every surface, and moving
// it with `<App>` would take Tailwind away from the fleet and the board.
//
// THE TRANSLATION IS APPLIED EXACTLY ONCE, BEFORE THE FIRST RENDER, AS A REPLACE:
//   - once, so it cannot loop — and `legacyRedirectFor` returning null for its own output means
//     even a second application would be a no-op;
//   - before the first render, because the surface is selected from the POST-rewrite address:
//     every legacy address this system ever advertised has a bare "/" pathname, so selecting
//     first would render the shell landing for all of them;
//   - `replaceState`, never `pushState` — a pushed entry makes the back button bounce between
//     the legacy URL and the canonical one, and the legacy URL then re-redirects. A replace
//     leaves the history stack exactly as deep as the operator's own navigation made it;
//   - from LOCATION-SHAPED PARTS, never a hand-composed string: `location.search` may be "" and
//     `location.hash` carries its own "#", so composing a URL by hand is how a fragment gets
//     corrupted (measured: F-45-01-G).
//
// `VITE_AOF_UI_MODE` is RETIRED with the query selector (ADR-002): a build-time constant that
// is undefined in the shipped bundle was a second input to a decision that must have one.

// `SurfaceBoundary`, so a home that fetches and (from story 05) holds sockets would have lived
// outside the crash containment and taken the chrome down with it. The route TABLE is untouched —
