// The freshness ramp's TWO renderings (milestone 43 / story 04; DESIGN
// §"The freshness ramp"): a dashed-outline pill and a provenance-line label.
// Both are painted from the ONE headless ramp module (./freshness.mjs) — the
// `status.tsx` pattern, where a ring, a chip and a dot all come from one source,
// so the board, the fleet and the legend can never disagree about the ramp.
//
// WHY A DASHED PILL. Every existing pill in the product is solid-filled or
// solid-bordered (the status chip, the kit Badge, the run/assignment chips, the
// type/lane chips), so a dashed pill is UNCLAIMED and can never be mistaken for
// one of them — while dashed is already the house's "degraded / not-yet / absent"
// primitive (the `not-started` ring carries this exact
// `border-dashed border-muted-foreground/45` literal). The connotation is already
// learned; this reuses it in pill form.
//
// WHY `muted`, NEVER `destructive`. `destructive` is spoken for on these surfaces
// by `blocked` items and `failed` runs. A stale cache row is neither: it is the
// mesh's ONLY readable copy of that work, and it is LATE, not wrong. Painting it
// red would over-alarm exactly the normal degraded state this milestone exists to
// normalise (the m25 node-presence judgement, inherited rather than re-litigated).
//
// NO MOTION, EVER. Motion in this product means "something is happening now".
// Staleness is the absence of something happening, so the ramp adds no animation
// and therefore no new `prefers-reduced-motion` surface.

// the badge attaches to the status-chip cluster, provenance lines use this form,
// and the two never both appear for the same record.
//
// The line is ALWAYS a sentence, including its unknowns: an omitted line reads as
// "there is no such fact", whereas `synced time unknown · from aof-wsl` states
// what is missing (DESIGN GAP D2 — a fact slot degrades to "unknown"; an
// assertion is withheld).
//
// `note` is a PERSISTENT FACT ABOUT THE WORLD appended to the line — today only
// `owner unreachable`, set by a Resync whose request could not be delivered. It
// lives on the LINE rather than in the message slot precisely because the slot
// holds acknowledgements, which decay: "`Requested` is a statement about a call
// we made; `owner unreachable` is a statement about the world, and it remains
// true until the world changes."

//
// ONE component for BOTH legends (the board's `◷ status legend` and the fleet's
// `◷ legend`), because a legend that documents a ramp from a second source is
// how a legend starts lying about the ramp it documents. The swatch is the REAL
// <StaleBadge>, fed the ramp module's own descriptor — never a hand-drawn pill,
// a static glyph or a copied class string.
//
// It renders from the ramp module alone, so it is correct BEFORE any data has
// arrived — which matters here, because "before any data arrives" is precisely
// the state in which no window has been received and the rows must degrade to
// words. It has no loading, error or empty state.
