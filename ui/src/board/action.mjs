// The state-aware PRIMARY action for the detail panel (DESIGN — "Run agent" is
// state-aware; ARCHITECTURE ADR-006). The detail panel's primary button derives
// BOTH its label and the aof slash-command it runs from the selected item's
// DERIVED status along the ACD lifecycle (refine → continue → verify). The
// command is later typed into the spawned agent as ordinary PTY input
// (the one terminal control, mounted by the board dock). Pure data — no React, no
// IO — so the mapping is unit-testable headlessly. Authored as .mjs (+
// action.d.mts) so the test imports it on Node >=20 without type-stripping,
// matching the ui/src/terminal/*.mjs convention.

// Derive the primary action for an item. Pure: status + ctx in, action out.
//   ctx.liveForRef  — dock open + bound to THIS ref → "View terminal" (wins over status)
//   ctx.hasBreakdown— item already broken down (milestone w/ >=1 story; else true)

  // about a LOCAL dock session, so an item a worker was actively executing still
  // offered "Continue" — clicking it dispatched a second run, which the assign core
  // then refused ("already has an active assignment held by <node>"). The row already
  // carries the answer (`execution.active` + the node), so read it here rather than
  // letting the operator discover it by being refused. Running work is watched, not
  // restarted.
  // Its own kind, NOT "view": the board's terminal dock is a LOCAL pty, so reusing

    // session is a SOURCE of the dock, never a second widget). A session the
    // worker reports as WAITING ON A HUMAN (code: needs-input) leads with that —
    // the affordance is the answer's door, not just a viewport. Without a
