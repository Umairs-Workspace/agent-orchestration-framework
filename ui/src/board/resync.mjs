// The RESYNC affordance's own state machine — milestone 43 / story 04
// (DESIGN §Surface 1c "Resync states — and the honest answer for an offline
// owner"; ARCHITECTURE 43/ADR-006 + ADR-010 R4.2/R4.3).
//
// WHY THIS IS A PURE HELPER, and not logic inside DetailPanel.tsx. The house
// pattern (ui/src/fleet/assign-affordance.mjs, ./runs.mjs, ./freshness.mjs):
// render-logic that must be node:test-exercisable lives in a pure .mjs with a
// .d.mts sibling, and the .tsx is a thin consumer that holds NO transition logic
// of its own. Every label, tone, disabled/busy flag, timer duration and message
// string this affordance ever shows is derived HERE, once.
//
// ── THE ONE SENTENCE THE WHOLE DESIGN HANGS ON ──────────────────────────────
// THE BUTTON REPORTS THE CALL; THE PROVENANCE LINE REPORTS THE DATA. `Requested`
// means the request went out. Only the age resetting and the badge clearing
// prove a fresh copy actually landed — which is exactly why there is NO SUCCESS
// TOAST anywhere in this module and no "resynced!" vocabulary to render one
// with. This is m38's F22 rule verbatim ("it reports the CALL; region 5 reports
// the ASSIGNMENT"), one milestone on: a toast would confirm the CLICK and let
// the operator believe the DATA is fresh.
//
// ── THE FOUR RULES THE STATE TABLE ENCODES ──────────────────────────────────
//  1. MUTED = the world did not answer. DESTRUCTIVE = the request was rejected.
//     An unreachable owner cost us NOTHING — the cached copy is intact and is
//     still the only readable one — so painting it red would over-alarm exactly
//     the condition this milestone exists to normalise. A coded refusal is a
//     fault we own and reads red like every other coded refusal on these
//     surfaces.
//  2. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS DECAY; FACTS PERSIST. `Requested` decays after exactly
//     one poll interval (`holdMs`). `owner <node> unreachable` is a statement
//     about the WORLD, so it persists on the provenance line (`lineNote`), not
//     in the message slot, until a fresher copy lands or a later attempt
//     re-evaluates it.
//  3. NEVER PRE-DISABLED ON PRESENCE. Nothing here reads a presence signal —
//     the board's wire carries none, presence lags by design, and one rule for
//     both surfaces beats a rule that forks by surface. Attempt, then report.
//  4. THE CACHED COPY IS NEVER HIDDEN BY A FAILURE. Every outcome message names
//     the age of the copy still on screen (`ageWord`), and none of them replaces
//     the provenance facts — the message has its own reserved slot.
//
// ── AND THE BOUND ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// No indefinite spinner, on either leg, and the two legs are DISTINCT:
//   - the REQUEST leg (`RESYNC_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS`) bounds the round trip to the
//     face. Past it the affordance stops waiting and reports "no answer".
//   - the WATCH leg (`RESYNC_WATCH_INTERVALS` × the board's poll interval)
//     bounds how long an ACCEPTED request is given for a fresher copy to arrive.
// Folding them into one timeout would silently swallow a slow-but-successful
// push, which is the defect the two-leg split exists to prevent.

// ── the two bounds ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// DESIGN's request round-trip bound ("no indefinite spinner … 10s for the
// request round trip"), expressed in POLL INTERVALS rather than as the
// millisecond literal DESIGN quotes. Two reasons, and the second is why the
// literal is FORBIDDEN rather than merely discouraged:
//
//   (a) the same reasoning m38's assign affordance already fixed for its own
//       hung-POST deadline — "one interval is too eager for a cross-machine
//       POST; two is past the point any answer is still useful";
//   (b) 43/ADR-014's review measured a REAL defect in the fixed form: a bound
//       shorter than the drain cadence made roughly one in three HEALTHY
//       resyncs report "no answer", because the deadline expired before the
//       daemon's own tick could possibly have answered. A bound that does not
//       move with the cadence it is racing is a bound that lies.
//
// TWO intervals, so it stays strictly INSIDE the three-interval watch window and
// the two legs remain distinguishable by construction rather than by arithmetic
// anyone could break.
export const RESYNC_REQUEST_INTERVALS = 2;

// DESIGN's watch window: "a watch window of 3 poll intervals for the pushed copy
// to arrive". Expressed in INTERVALS, never in milliseconds, because the
// interval itself is the BOARD's own poll cadence and is supplied by the
// consumer (`pollMs`) rather than re-declared here. One number, defined where it
// is used, measured where it is consumed — never a second literal beside it.
export const RESYNC_WATCH_INTERVALS = 3;

// ── the phases ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// ── the coded outcomes, and the tone each one earns ─────────────────────────
//
// The wire contract is `src/mesh/resync.mjs`'s, read here and nowhere else in
// `ui/`. The mapping onto DESIGN's state table is 1:1 and deliberate:
//
//   resync-requested            → accepted     (the request reached the owner)
//   resync-pending              → no answer    (the request leg's own bound)
//   resync-owner-not-connected  → unreachable  (MUTED — the world did not answer)
//   resync-owner-unreachable    → unreachable  (MUTED)
//   resync-owner-is-self        → SELF         (MUTED — no call was made at all)
//   resync-no-owner             → refused      (DESTRUCTIVE — a fault we own)
//   anything else               → refused      (DESTRUCTIVE, code shown verbatim)
//
// Only a REJECTION is destructive. Everything else is the world failing to
// answer, and the cached copy is intact throughout.
//
// `resync-owner-is-self` is 43/ADR-014's correction, and it earns its own state
// rather than borrowing `owner unreachable`: a row THIS node authored goes stale
// exactly when this node's own publish tick stops, and answering "not connected"

//   `node`    — the owning node the request is aimed at (from the provenance).
