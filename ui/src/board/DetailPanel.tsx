//   milestone → SPEC · VERIFICATION · RETROSPECTIVE · Findings   (these docs live at the MILESTONE)
//   story     → STORY                                            (the user story + its tasks checklist)
//   uat       → Findings                                         (its SESSION record carries findings)
// A story does NOT have its own VERIFICATION/RETROSPECTIVE — those belong to its
// milestone — so they are not offered as story tabs (showing them as "none" was a
// bug). Selection-driven; Run agent keeps the run-agent → terminal wire. Doc
// bodies come from /api/work/doc (absent → placeholder); frontmatter + HTML
// comments are stripped for display.
