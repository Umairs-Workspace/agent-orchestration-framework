// The SURFACE side of the shell's two contribution regions (milestone 45 / story 03;
// ADR-005 contract point 5, DESIGN §The scope-control ruling and §Surface 1's R1/R3).
//
// A routed surface does not know where its controls end up. It says "these are mine" and the
// shell decides which row holds them — the top bar at 1280, the surface bar at 768 and below.
// DESIGN's rule is the whole reason this exists: "surfaces contribute their own controls into
// a named slot; the shell does not author them." A shell that authored the fleet's scope
// control would have to know what a scope is, and then 46, 47 and 49 all queue behind it.
//
// WHEN NO SHELL IS PRESENT THE CONTRIBUTION RENDERS IN PLACE, and that is not a fallback —
// it is what keeps the surfaces honest when mounted alone (test/support/fleet-app-harness.mjs
// and board-app-harness.mjs mount the surface COMPONENT directly, which task 00 requires to
// keep working with no edit), and it is what a surface's own bar did before the shell existed.
//
// THE `deps` ARGUMENT IS NOT OPTIONAL POLISH. The contribution is published from an effect,
// so it must re-publish when — and ONLY when — the contributed content actually changes. An
// effect with no dependency list would re-publish on every render, the shell would re-render,
// the surface would re-render inside it, and the two would spin forever. Pass every value the
// contributed nodes CAPTURE (the fleet's `scope`, its `fetchedAt`, …); anything omitted goes
// stale in the bar while the surface's own body updates, which is the one failure a reviewer
// should look for here.

// operator still needs (DG-46-1).
//
// THE DEGRADED PATH IS WHY THIS IS A CONTRIBUTION rather than a layer the board paints itself:
// mounted with no shell — which is exactly what `test/support/board-app-harness.mjs` does — the
// dock renders IN PLACE, as the board's own last flex child, exactly where it has always
// rendered, and that harness needs no edit. `shrink-0` is the in-place render's own fact and
// nothing else: the board's column is `flex flex-col` and the dock declares its own height, so
// without it the wrapper would be free to squeeze the height the clamp just decided.
