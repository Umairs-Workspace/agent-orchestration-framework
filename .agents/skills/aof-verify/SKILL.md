# verify

Use the native skill $aof-verify; $ARGUMENTS is the operator text after its name.

Acceptance requires evidence for every selected executable/manual/UAT lane and no open Blocker. Distinguish observed live behavior from fixtures or inference. A missing native capability or unanswered genuine human UAT remains unverified. The main governing session owns finding ids, retrospective/outcome prose and the acceptance verdict. Require real controls and negative probes, scoped validation/doctor, and a recorded clean regression gate before milestone acceptance. Accept a milestone only when all its stories are accepted. Continue evidence alone is not acceptance.

## Codex execution contract
Use only tools actually exposed by this session. File reading/editing, shell execution, search,
browser/image tools and native role tools are capability-dependent; Claude tool aliases are not
permissions. Instruction-level read-only boundaries do not claim enforced sandbox isolation.
In solo mode perform required roles inline and spawn nothing. Orchestrated independent work
requires a native launcher such as spawn_agent when exposed, independent context and support
for each selected model/effort; otherwise report native-role-capability-unavailable or
native-role-setting-unsupported before claiming independence. Stay within the resolved dispatch
bound and review/no-progress bounds. Read role settings from work.agents.runtimes.codex.
Never infer the primary assistant from the delegation toggle.
For questions, use an available native question tool, or ask explicitly in the conversation when
that tool is unavailable. Required answers remain pending until received. A driven business question
retains its map token and one-question-per-ask form. Permission approval uses the host approval flow,
not a question tool or elapsed time. AOF_NEEDS_INPUT is for an actually unanswered blocked turn,
never a fabricated native capability.

Read procedure.md for this procedure and .codex/aof/workflows/workflow-contract.md for shared ownership, evidence and bounds. Load no unrelated procedure to interpret these gates.
