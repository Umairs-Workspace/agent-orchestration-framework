name: aof-add-spike
description: Capture a spike — a top-level de-risk driver scaffolded on the project's intake as spike_slug/SPIKE.md. Groups no stories, carries no .feature; its deliverable is a recorded finding. Numbered by aof work promote, resolved later by aof:verify.

<!-- aof-generated: true; aof-runtime: codex -->

Use this skill when the user asks for `$aof-add-spike <the unknown / risk to de-risk> [in <group/path>] [timebox 1d|2d|…] [depends NN[,NN…]]`, or asks to run the AOF `aof:add-spike` procedure in Codex.

Where this procedure mentions `$ARGUMENTS`, use the text the user supplied after the skill name.
Where it mentions Claude slash command `/aof:add-spike`, treat that as this Codex skill invocation.

<objective>
Frame a **spike**: a self-contained `spike_<slug>/SPIKE.md` folder, born un-numbered on the project's
intake and given its number by one verb, `aof work promote`. A spike is a top-level DRIVER
(the `uat` shape, ADR-001) — it delivers no new behaviour and groups no stories; it exists to resolve
one unknown *before* a dependent milestone can be committed. It gates the stream: downstream work that
`depends:` on it waits until it is `done`. Don't confuse it with `aof:refine`'s in-milestone researcher
(a question scoped inside one milestone) — a spike is worth its own roadmap slot.
</objective>

<config>
Read `.aof/aof.config.json` → `work.dir`, `work.agents`, `work.intake`. An ABSENT `work.intake` reads
as `"stream"`; only the exact string `"backlog"` selects the backlog. Resolve refs with
`aof work find` / `aof work next --json` — never hand-glob `**/*.md`.
</config>

<process>
For: "$ARGUMENTS"
1. **The folder — the backlog, under either setting.** Slug = kebab (e.g. `de-risk-mesh-routing`). An
   optional group comes from the arguments (`in <group/path>`) and is a PATH and nothing more. The
   folder is `<work.dir>/backlog/[<group>/]spike_<slug>/`: that is where a new spike is written
   whichever way `work.intake` is set. Do NOT work out a stream number — deciding one is
   `aof work promote`'s job (41/ADR-002).
2. **Scope (`depends:`).** A spike is usually a *dependency*, not a dependent — leave `depends: []`
   unless the spike itself needs a prior milestone/spike/chore resolved first. If given explicitly
   (`depends NN,NN`), write those entries AS GIVEN — they are a planning note until promotion, which
   is where they are VALIDATED (a numeric ref must resolve; an entry naming another backlog slug is
   refused, so promote that one first or drop the entry).
3. **Scaffold** (template: `.aof/templates/work/spike/SPIKE.md`): frontmatter (`type: spike`, a bare
   `number:` with NO value, `slug`, `title`, `status: not-started`, `owner`, `created`/`updated`:
   today, `depends: [...]`, `timebox`: the given box or a sensible default); the heading is
   `# <Title>` with no number prefix; `## Question` (the unknown, framed as a real question);
   `## Timebox` (the box + stop condition); `## Investigation` (empty — filled as the spike runs);
   `## Finding` (empty — the deliverable); `## Outcome / Next` (empty — what it unblocks).
4. **Then the intake decides whether it stays there.** Under `work.intake: "backlog"` it STAYS:
   `aof:promote <slug>` is what later schedules it, and the only way to name a position. Under
   `"stream"` (or an absent key) run `aof work promote <slug> --json` immediately and report the
   minted ref — appended at the tail, as `add-spike` has always landed it.
5. Ask only the framing questions you can't infer (the question itself, the timebox).
6. **Frame ONLY** — no investigation started, no finding recorded (that's the spike running, then
   `aof:verify`). No `tasks/`, no `.feature` — a spike carries no behavioural contract.
</process>

<progress_tracking>
The spike starts at `status: not-started` in `SPIKE.md` frontmatter. Running it (the investigation,
recording `## Finding`) and flipping it to `done` — which unblocks anything that `depends:` on it — is
`aof:verify <NN>`: confirms `## Finding` is filled and the unknown is resolved. No scenario run, no
"tests green" — the investigation code is throwaway.
</progress_tracking>

<output>
Report the path + the question this spike answers, and — when `depends` was given — that the entries
are validated at promotion. Under `"backlog"`: next is `aof:promote <slug>`. Under `"stream"`: report
the minted ref. Then run the investigation, record the finding, and `aof:verify <NN>`.
</output>
