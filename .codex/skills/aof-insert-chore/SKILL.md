description: Insert a chore at a target position — scaffold NN_chore_slug at --at P and re-index every item ≥ P up by one, keeping the stream valid. The placement twin of add-chore.
---

<!-- aof-generated: true; aof-runtime: codex -->

Use this skill when the user asks for `$aof-insert-chore <the housekeeping to do> at <position P> [depends NN[,NN…]]`, or asks to run the AOF `aof:insert-chore` procedure in Codex.

Where this procedure mentions `$ARGUMENTS`, use the text the user supplied after the skill name.
Where it mentions Claude slash command `/aof:insert-chore`, treat that as this Codex skill invocation.

<objective>
Frame a **chore** at a **specific position** `P` in the stream — not appended at the tail. The
placement twin of `aof:add-chore`, and since milestone 127 exactly what its name says: a scaffold into
the backlog, PROMOTED AT `P`. It writes the SAME self-contained `chore_<slug>/CHORE.md`
`add-chore` writes, then hands it to `aof work promote --at P` — the one verb that mints a number —
which slots it at `P` and re-indexes every pre-existing item that was `≥ P` up by exactly one. A chore is a
top-level DRIVER that delivers no new behaviour and groups no stories; it exists to sequence
housekeeping *before* whatever depends on it. Use when the housekeeping belongs *beside* related items
in the roadmap, not after everything added later.
</objective>

<config>
Read `.aof/aof.config.json` → `work.dir`, `work.agents`. Resolve refs with `aof work find` /
`aof work next --json` — never hand-glob `**/*.md`.
</config>

<process>
For: "$ARGUMENTS"
1. **Resolve slug + position + scope.** Slug = kebab from the housekeeping description. Target position
   `P` = the `at <P>` the caller gave. Leave `depends: []` unless given explicitly (`depends NN,NN`);
   each must resolve to a real driver.
2. **Placement + re-index is MECHANICAL — the CLI, never hand-edited.** Run
   `aof work insert-chore "<slug>" --at <P> --json`. This scaffolds from
   `.aof/templates/work/chore/` (the SAME template `add-chore` uses) AND renumbers every item `≥ P` up
   by one, rewriting `depends`/`parent`/frontmatter so nothing dangles — leaving `aof work validate`
   green. **Never** renumber or rewrite by hand (ADR-002).
3. **Count-gated confirmation (ADR-004).** If the CLI reports the shift needs confirmation (many items
   must move), surface the count and re-run with `--yes` once the user confirms. A handful proceeds
   automatically.
4. **Frame the prose into the scaffolded CHORE.** Author `## Intent` (what housekeeping + why) and
   `## Definition of Done` (a checkbox list — always include `aof work validate` green) into the new
   `CHORE.md` — ask only what you can't infer. **Frame ONLY** — no boxes ticked yet, no `tasks/`, no
   `.feature` (a chore carries no behavioural contract).
</process>

<progress_tracking>
The chore lands at `status: not-started` in `CHORE.md`, occupying position `P`. Doing the work
(ticking `## Definition of Done`) and flipping it to `done` — which unblocks anything that `depends:`
on it — is `aof:verify <P>`.
</progress_tracking>

<output>
Report the path + position + the intent, and confirm `aof work validate` is green after the re-index.
Next: do the housekeeping, tick the checklist, then `aof:verify <P>`.
</output>
