// `aof planning init` — install the bought planner (`phuryn/pm-skills`) through
// the runtime's own plugin CLI and record pinned-sha provenance (milestone 02 /
// story 00). A THIN wrapper over the runtime plugin CLI, structured exactly like
// the GSD framework installer (`src/frameworks.mjs`): a plan of commands, a
// `--dry-run` that prints and spawns nothing, then a per-item network boundary
// print + warning before each networked, code-executing step, executed via
// argv-based spawn (no shell string), with a simulation hook for tests.
//
//   ADR-001: aof owns the seam, not the install. The plan is one
//     `<runtime> plugin marketplace add <source>` followed by one
//     `<runtime> plugin install <plugin>@pm-skills` per recommended plugin (verb
//     `install`, marketplace token `pm-skills`). Guarded by
//     acd-planning-install-commands.
//   ADR-007 (supersedes ADR-001's marketplace-source invariant; the pinned REF is
//     itself superseded by ADR-008 below): the marketplace-add source is the HTTPS
//     git URL — `<runtime> plugin marketplace add https://github.com/phuryn/pm-skills.git#<ref>`
//     — NEVER the `phuryn/pm-skills@<ref>` shorthand, which Claude resolves to an
//     SSH clone (`git@github.com:`) that fails `Permission denied (publickey)` for
//     HTTPS-only GitHub auth (VERIFICATION.md Finding F1). The per-plugin install
//     token stays the manifest name `<plugin>@pm-skills` (only the clone source
//     needs HTTPS). Same shared marketplace-add builder serves claude AND codex.
//   ADR-008 (supersedes ADR-007's `#<sha>` REF): `claude plugin marketplace add
//     <url>#<ref>` runs `git clone --branch <ref>`, which resolves only a branch or
//     TAG name — NOT a bare 40-hex commit sha (VERIFICATION.md Finding F2). So the
//     emitted `#<ref>` is the immutable release TAG (`MARKETPLACE_REF = v2.0.0`),
//     the tightest clonable pin the runtime accepts — never the bare sha. The clone
//     ref (command) and the provenance sha (manifest) are decoupled: resolveSha
//     resolves the TAG (`git ls-remote <url> refs/tags/v2.0.0`) to its 40-hex
//     commit for the manifest, so ADR-002/003 hold unchanged. The dry-run can now
//     preview the real tag with no network call (the tag is statically known).
//   ADR-002: the recorded sha MUST be a 40-char lowercase-hex commit id; a
//     floating ref (branch/tag/HEAD/short/uppercase) is refused before any write.
//     Guarded by acd-planning-provenance-sha.
//   ADR-003 → ADR-009: provenance is written via read-merge-write into the SINGLE
//     unified project lock `.aof/aof.lock.json` (workspacePaths().lockPath) as its
//     `planning` section — the separate per-vertical provenance file is eliminated.
//     planning init owns ONLY the `planning` key: it reads the current lock and
//     writes `{ ...currentLock, planning: <provenance> }`, preserving the flat
//     asset fields and the `work` section it does not own, and never reconstructs
//     the lock from a fixed field set. The provenance object is the frozen schema
//     below minus its own `version` (the unified lock carries ONE top-level
//     version). Guarded by acd-planning-lock-isolation (section-isolation).
//   ADR-004: Claude is the default + only fully-scripted runtime; Codex degrades
//     honestly — register the marketplace only, record pluginsInstalled:false, emit
//     a manual fallback, never emit the absent Codex plugin-install verb. Guarded
//     by acd-planning-no-codex-install.
//   ADR-006: idempotent via a manifest guard with --force (mirrors `work init`).
//   ADR-010: the claude marketplace/plugin declarations default to PROJECT scope
//     (`--scope project`) so the bought planner travels with the repo's
//     `.claude/settings.json`, NOT the user's global `~/.claude/settings.json`
//     (the runtime CLI itself defaults to `--scope user`, which is the wrong default
//     for a per-project planner). Overridable via
//     `aof planning init --scope <user|project|local>`. `--scope` is a
//     claude-settings concept, so the flag is emitted ONLY on claude commands; the
//     codex marketplace-add carries no scope flag (codex registration is its own
//     mechanism), while the codex MANUAL fallback (`claude plugin install …`) DOES
//     carry `--scope <scope>` since the user runs it through claude. Guarded by
