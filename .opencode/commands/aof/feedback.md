description: Capture feedback the instant it's noticed — a mistake, misunderstanding, blocker, or (on a UAT session) an acceptance observation — as a raw, attributed entry in the right log. Low-friction: it never classifies or asks how to file; triage does that later. Any actor can raise it.
---

<objective>
Log feedback the instant it's noticed, with zero friction — **capture now, classify never**. Append a
raw, attributed entry to the right running log and confirm. This command does NOT judge severity,
finding-vs-lesson, or routing, and must **never stop to ask the user how or where to file it** — the
item's type decides the log, and triage (`aof:verify` / `aof:retrospective`) does the rest.
</objective>

<config>
Parse "$ARGUMENTS": an optional leading **ref** (milestone `NN`, story `NN/SS`, or uat session `NN`)
then the **feedback text** (free-form — what was noticed).

Resolve the ref with `aof work find "<ref>" --json` (no ref → the active item via `aof work next
--json`, else the most-recent `in-progress` milestone/uat). **Route by the target's type —
automatically, never by asking:**

- **uat session** → its `SESSION.md` **`## Findings`**. A note raised against a UAT acceptance gate
  *is* a finding — that's the session's capture surface, so it gets tracked, routed, and fixed (not
  merely distilled into a lesson). Do **not** ask whether it's "really" a finding; on a uat item it is.
- **milestone** (or a **story/task**, which bubbles up to its parent milestone) → its `STATE.md`
  **`## Feedback (for retro)`**.

Either way the entry is a raw **event**, not a triaged record. Severity, type, routing (`amend in`), or
"this was only a process lesson" are decided **later** — `aof:verify` triages findings,
`aof:retrospective` distils feedback. Capture is cheap; **never block on classification.**
</config>

<process>
1. **Locate + pick the log** by target type (above). Create the section if it doesn't exist.
2. **Append one raw, attributed entry** in that log's existing format — low-friction, not a distilled
   record:
   - **uat `## Findings`** → a new row/block matching the table already there: the next `F-NN` id, what
     was observed (the note, dated today), `status: open`. Leave severity / type / `amend in` blank for
     triage. Capture any concrete pointer the user gave (a screen, a design-bundle reference) verbatim.
   - **milestone/story `## Feedback (for retro)`** → one bullet: the note, **Raised by** <actor>
     (you / architect / developer / qa / po / security), optional `Refs` (ADR / scenario / commit —
     reference, never restate). Use `aof work feedback <ref> --note "<verbatim text>" --actor
     <actor> [--refs <refs>]`; do not edit `STATE.md` directly. That capture seam appends the
     immutable raw record first and only then its human-readable log projection.
3. **Confirm** what was recorded and where. Do **not** classify, prioritise, route, dedup, or prompt —
   the type already chose the log; triage happens later.
</process>

<output>
Report the item + the entry appended and which log it went to. Findings are triaged at `aof:verify`;
feedback is distilled at `aof:retrospective`.
</output>
