# 23 · Control Node + Thin Relay — live presence over a stateless broker

## Objective

The **live substrate** of the mesh (origin:
[PRD-decentralized-agent-orchestration](../../planning/PRD-decentralized-agent-orchestration.md), §7.3/§7.4).
Git alone syncs at a ~10–30 s cadence — too slow for the headline "see what other agents are working on
*right now*." This milestone adds the one piece of coordination git can't give cheaply, and **nothing
more**: a thin, **stateless relay** hosted by a nominated **control node**, carrying *ephemeral* signals
only.

It introduces (1) the **control node as a role** — one nominated node hosts the relay and is the
liveness hub; re-nominate-able to any node, **not** special hardware and **not** a durability SPOF (git
stays replicated; lose it and only liveness pauses, never data); (2) the **thin relay** itself — a
lightweight self-hosted broker that ships as the same aof binary in a `relay` mode, persisting **nothing
authoritative** (every signal has a durable git counterpart), so it is a cache/accelerator, never the
system of record; and (3) **presence / heartbeat** — each node periodically writes a heartbeat (node id,
timestamp, active runs) pushed over the relay (sub-5-s) *and* into git (durable fallback); a stale
heartbeat renders the node stale. This is the PRD's **push-for-liveness, poll-for-durability** split (A5).

An outsider can verify the objective is met when a peer's change shows on another node within **≤ 5 s over
the relay** and **≤ 30 s with the relay killed**, a node that goes quiet is shown stale, and killing the
relay (or the control node) mid-fleet loses **liveness, not data** — the fleet degrades cleanly to
git-only sync (KR1, and the liveness half of KR5).

## Scope

In scope:
- **The thin stateless relay** — a lightweight self-hosted broker carrying *ephemeral* signals only;
  ships as the same aof binary in a `relay` mode (no separate product to install).
- **The control node as a role** — one nominated node hosts the relay and is the liveness hub;
  re-nominate-able; never a durability SPOF (git stays replicated).
- **Presence / heartbeat** — each node writes a heartbeat (node id, timestamp, active runs) pushed over
  relay + git; stale heartbeat → shown stale.
- **Push-for-liveness, poll-for-durability (PRD A5)** — presence pushed over the relay; durable state
  still syncs by git poll; relay loss degrades cleanly to poll-only.

Out of scope:
- **Device-code enrollment + the relay's credential issuance** — milestone 24 (this milestone stands the
  relay up; enrollment makes it joinable).
- **`aof mesh ui`** — milestone 25 renders presence visually; here it is exposed via `aof mesh status` +
  the records.
- **Lease / claim fast-path arbitration + fleet orphan reclaim** — milestone 26 (the relay's *second*
  signal class; this milestone carries presence, not claims).
- **The relay as a system of record** — it persists nothing authoritative; correctness never depends on
  it (PRD §7.3, A2).
- **Packaging the `relay`-mode binary for cross-OS install** — milestone 28.

## Stories

<!-- The stories that compose this milestone. Each is its own NN_story_<slug> item with parent: 23.
     Populated at the Break-down stage (refine); "to be broken down" until then. The milestone is
     accepted when all its stories are. -->

Broken down `2026-06-30` by `aof:refine 23 --autonomous`. The partition follows the codebase-graph coupling
([ARCHITECTURE.md §Story break-down rationale](ARCHITECTURE.md)): the presence record extends two existing
low-fan-out spines (`mesh-store.mjs`'s reserved `presenceRecordPath` + `run-store.mjs`'s `isStale`) over **git
alone**; the relay is a **file-disjoint** serve subtree (the `board-serve`/`terminal-ws` `ws@8` neighbourhood)
importing **no** record schema; and the dual-bus integration is the **single** cross-story edge. So {00, 01}
are independent parallel siblings and 02 is the lone integration dependent — touching only the additive
co-touched door (`command-core.mjs`'s `COMMANDS` array + `cli.mjs`'s `meshCommand` dispatcher — the 07/ADR-006
discipline). Unlike m22, the spine does **not** bootstrap a face or author a gate: the `aof mesh` face + the
`mesh:`-bijection gate already exist (the inverse-22/R1 dividend).

- [x] **00 · [presence / heartbeat — the durable git-side substrate](stories/00_story_presence-heartbeat/STORY.md)** — `src/mesh-presence.mjs` (the `presence/<node>.json` record on the m22-reserved seam; node-staleness reusing milestone 20's `isStale` shape; the `activeRuns` read of the run records) + `mesh:heartbeat` (git-only publish) + the `mesh:status` presence/stale render + the two m22 carry-forwards (the `.gitattributes` EOL pin F1/R5 + the self-host `.mesh` ignore R4). Works over **git alone**. The dependency root for presence; **parallel with 01**.
- [x] **01 · [the thin stateless relay](stories/01_story_thin-relay/STORY.md)** — `src/mesh-relay.mjs` (`serveRelay` — the `ws@8` broker shipping as the same binary in a `relay` mode, the frozen payload-agnostic envelope, statelessness) + the control-node nomination role/config (`config.mesh.relay.*`), **pre-auth in m23** (enrollment is m24). A file-disjoint serve subtree; **parallel with 00**.
- [x] **02 · [push-for-liveness, poll-for-durability](stories/02_story_presence-over-relay/STORY.md)** — the node-side two-publish path (git **unconditional** + relay **best-effort**, caught-never-thrown) + the cadence loop + the KR1 (≤5s/≤30s) + liveness-half-of-KR5 integration + the A1 3-node `@manual` spike + **the F1 receive-and-apply consumer** (the persistent relay subscriber + in-memory liveness cache + the `mesh:status` overlay, ADR-004). The single cross-story edge; **depends on 00 + 01**. _Accepted `2026-07-01` (`aof:verify 23`): all `@executable` green + fitness #7 green; the `@manual` ≤5s re-measurement PASSES on a real 3-node ws@8 fleet (worst-case both-nodes reflection 11.9/4.8 ms across two runs, over the relay, no git sync), the ≤30s git floor + clean degradation + re-nomination all PASS — **F1 resolved**, story `done`._

## Dependencies

- **22 · mesh-foundation** — builds directly on node identity (whose heartbeat is whose) and the git-sync
  engine + path-partitioning: `presence/<node>.json` is an add-only partitioned record git already
  carries durably, and the relay merely *accelerates* it to sub-5-s. No relay without the substrate
  underneath it.
- **20 · autonomous-run-resilience** — presence, heartbeat, and staleness are the **fleet face of
  milestone 20's liveness**. 20 builds the single-node heartbeat + stale-detection; this milestone
  *extends* them outward over the relay, rather than standing up a parallel heartbeat — which is what
  makes it a genuine edge, not just ordering. A node's "active runs" in its heartbeat reads the run
  records 20 sits on (milestone 19, transitively). The orphan **reclaim** that re-leases a stale peer's
  run lands later in milestone 26; the **presence + staleness** that detects it is built here, on 20.
