  Milestone DESIGN.md — answers ONE question: how should it look and feel, and why?
  Owner: designer (aof-designer). Captures INTENT + RATIONALE (why this state reads as a peer of the
  existing ones), NOT pixel specs. UI BEHAVIOUR (what the hook contract dispatches, TTL numbers, the
  session↔run reconciliation rule) is a task-feature / ARCHITECTURE outcome, cross-referenced below,
  not specified here.

  CORRECTION LOG (kept visible on purpose — the corrections ARE the lesson):
  - 2026-07-12 — §Correction 1. §Surface 1 originally named `NodeCard` (ui/src/fleet/Fleet.tsx) as the
    conformance baseline and enumerated its four-row anatomy. That component is NEVER MOUNTED by the
    web app. Caught by the design-conformance review of the live render.
  - 2026-07-12 — §Correction 2. The checklist (S1/S7/S9, written by the designer the same day) modelled
    reconciliation as PER-NODE: "run wins, the session never renders." Reality is PER-WORKSPACE. The
    live fleet falsified it. The current-work region is a bounded STACK of 1–2 lines, not one line.
  - 2026-07-23 — §Correction 3. V10 (authored the same day) enumerated the terminal assignment states
    as "done / failed / reclaimed". `withdrawn` and `stale` fell through and read `waiting for output`
    forever. An ENUMERATION was the wrong instrument: the m35 chip ramp already decides terminal-ness
    and already owns the words. V10 now derives both from `assignmentChip(row)`. WITNESSED render F.
  All three wrong texts are struck through, not deleted.

# 38 · Cross-machine worker execution & session presence — Design

## Intent

This milestone changes **one thing you can see**: the **current-work region** on a fleet node — the
region that today reads either `idle` (muted) or `running N runs` (primary), derived solely from
`presence.activeRuns`. The milestone adds a **live coding-assistant session** as a first-class presence
signal, so a node being actively worked on — an editor open on a repo, no aof task-run — no longer reads
the lie `idle`. It gains a new state in the same region: **`working · <repo> (session)`**.

That region renders on **two real surfaces** (see §Surface 1): the **web** fleet node card and the
**Rust/Tauri desktop** node row. Nothing else on either surface changes — every other row is **carried
forward verbatim**. It is deliberately built as a **peer of the existing run-state signal**, not a fourth
vocabulary: it reuses the run-state ramp's tokens (`primary` for active, `muted` for absent) and the
whole surface's "colour AND label always travel together" rail (m25 DESIGN §Documented-defaults 1). The
reader must be able to tell **idle vs running vs working** at a glance, in the same idiom, **on both
surfaces**.

> ~~"This milestone touches **one** visual surface: the **fleet NodeCard's status line** (row 3) in
> `ui/src/fleet/Fleet.tsx`."~~ — **WRONG, corrected 2026-07-12.** `NodeCard` is not mounted (§Correction 1).
> ~~"This is a **one-line**, one-new-state change."~~ — **WRONG, corrected 2026-07-12.** The region is a
> bounded stack of **1–2 lines** (§Correction 2). It is a **one-REGION** change.

**Binding rails (carried from m25, honoured here):**
- **Read-only — the surface renders, it never mutates.** The session signal is a rendered fact off the
  presence aggregate; the card gains no control. (m25 read-only rail, unchanged.)
  > **Story 04 (2026-07-18) carves out ONE deliberate exception to this rail** — the fleet's first
  > mutation affordance, the assign-to-node control on the work-item card (ADR-012). It does **not**
  > overturn the read-only posture; the surface stays a monitor and the carve-out reads as a quiet,
  > subordinate control. See **§Surface 2**.
  > **Story 06 (2026-07-19) carves out a SECOND exception — a READ one, not a mutation** — the read-only
  > terminal-VIEW that mirrors a worker's live PTY onto the fleet face (ADR-014). The fleet face previously
  > served NO terminal upgrade; it now serves a server→browser mirror. It adds NO write path: read-only IN
  > FACT and IN LOOK. See **§Surface 3**.
- **Reuse the existing ramps / tokens — invent no fleet-local vocabulary.** The `working` state reads
  in the **run-state ramp's** two tokens it already touches: **active work = `primary`** (the same
  emphasis `running N runs` carries), **no work = `muted`** (the same `idle` reads). It does **not**
  introduce a new colour, a new dot, or a session-specific accent. The `(session)` qualifier and the repo
  name are the label that distinguishes it — never colour alone.
- **Self-expiring liveness, never a stuck "working."** A session past its TTL is dropped by the
  presence aggregate before it reaches the card (mirroring m23 heartbeat staleness). The card renders
  **only what the aggregate hands it** — it never recomputes session liveness and never shows a
  "working" the aggregate no longer asserts. An expired session ⇒ the region falls back to `idle`.

---

## Correction 1 — the checklist named a component production never mounts

**Kept on purpose. This is a lesson of the milestone, not an embarrassment to bury.**

This DESIGN originally pinned its conformance baseline to **`NodeCard`** (`ui/src/fleet/Fleet.tsx`) and
enumerated **its** four-row anatomy. The build and the build-time design review were then both aimed at
`NodeCard`.

**`NodeCard` is never mounted by the web app.** `Fleet.tsx:167` branches
`isGlobalStatus(status) ? <GlobalScopeView/> : <NodesRegion/>`, and `src/mesh-ui-serve.mjs` serves
**both** `?scope=global` and `?scope=local` from `queryGlobalMeshStatus`, whose payload always carries a
`workspaces` array — so `isGlobalStatus()` is **always true**, `GlobalScopeView` → **`GlobalNodePanel`**
(`Fleet.tsx:537`) is **always** what renders, and `NodesRegion` → `NodeCard` is dead in every scope.

- **`NodeCard` is NOT a conformance surface.** It must never again be named as the baseline.
- **A checklist that enumerates the wrong anatomy is worse than no checklist** — it lets a reviewer tick
  four rows against a six-row card and return a confident CONFORMS. That is exactly what happened, and a
  synthetic fixture kept it plausible.
- **The desktop was never in this doc at all** — an entire rendering surface, in another language,
  invisible to the design. It is §Surface 1b now.

---

## Correction 2 — reconciliation is PER-WORKSPACE, not per-node (and the region is a stack)

**Also kept on purpose — and note who was wrong: the designer, in this checklist, on the same day.**

S1/S7/S9 as first written bound a **per-node** model: *"the line reads exactly one of three states"*,
*"run + session ⇒ `running N runs`, **never** the session"*, *"must not change card height."* A live,
producer-fed render (FRAME A) falsified all three: `umamis-msi`, with a real run in the `aof` workspace
and a live session in the `pilot-app-portal` workspace, renders **two stacked lines** —
`running 1 run` above `working · pilot-app-portal (session)` — and the card grows by one line.

**The build is right; the checklist was wrong.** A node hosts **N workspaces**. A run in `aof` and an
editor open on `pilot-app-portal` are **two different pieces of work on one machine**, not competing
claims about one piece. Enforcing the old S7 literally would **suppress the `pilot-app-portal` session** —
the card would hide that a human is working in it, **reintroducing the exact lie of omission this
milestone exists to kill, at a new address.** (The projection is even named `fleetCurrentWorkLines` —
*plural*. The code knew; the doc did not.)

**Evidence it is per-workspace, from the pixels as a set:** FRAME A (run live) shows only
`pilot-app-portal` — the `aof` workspace's own session is subsumed by its run. FRAME B, minutes later,
run complete, shows `working · pilot-app-portal, aof (session)` — the `aof` session reappears the moment
its run ends. Same node, same sessions; the only variable is the run.

The corrected rules are **S1 / S6 / S7 / S9 / S11** below.

---

## Correction 3 — a state ENUMERATION in V10 leaked two terminal states (2026-07-23)

**Kept on purpose, and note again who was wrong: the designer, in a rule authored hours earlier.**

V10 (written at the first render pass) said the honest-empty copy applies to an assignment in a terminal
state **"(`done` / `failed` / `reclaimed`)"**. The fleet's assignment vocabulary has more terminal states
than that: **`withdrawn`** (operator-stopped, ADR-001) and **`stale`** both end an assignment, and both
fell through the list — so a withdrawn or stale assignment's terminal-view would sit on
`waiting for output` **forever**, which is the exact lie V10 exists to kill, at two new addresses. The
developer spotted the hole and correctly **refused to invent copy for them**.

**The enumeration was the wrong instrument.** `ui/src/fleet/assignments.mjs` (the m35 §4 ramp) ALREADY
decides which states are terminal and ALREADY owns the words for them: `withdrawn` reads as **`failed`**,
`reclaimed`/`stale` read as **`failed` + a `· reclaimed` note**, and an unrecognised state degrades to
`unknown`. A second, hand-maintained list of terminal states in the terminal-view is a **second
vocabulary for one fact** — the fourth-ramp mistake S5/A8 exist to prevent — and it drifts the moment a
state is added, which is precisely what happened within a day.

**V10 is corrected to derive BOTH terminal-ness and the wording from `assignmentChip(row)`.** No list.
The `TERMINAL_ASSIGNMENT_STATES` set is deleted. **WITNESSED render F (2026-07-23):** a `done` card reads
`no live output — assignment done`, a `stale`+`reclaimedAt` card reads `no live output — assignment
failed · reclaimed` — the SAME words the same card's assignment chip and node summary use.

## Conformance source of truth — binding checklist, NO new mock

> **There is NO new mock for this milestone.** At refine the user chose **binding-checklist-only**.
> The **binding checklist below (§Surface 1) is the conformance source of truth** the

> The **baseline is the CURRENT render of the surfaces production actually mounts**: (a) the web

> ~~"The **baseline is the CURRENT `NodeCard` render**…"~~ — **WRONG, corrected 2026-07-12. See §Correction 1.**

> **Story 04 addendum — 2026-07-18.** Story 04 adds the fleet's FIRST mutation affordance — an
> **assign-to-node** control on the **work-item (milestone) card** (a DIFFERENT card from §Surface 1's

> **Story 06 addendum — 2026-07-19, updated 2026-07-23.** Story 06 opens carve-out #2 on the read-only
> fleet face — a **READ-ONLY terminal-VIEW** that mirrors a worker's live PTY (ADR-014). It is a DIFFERENT

> ~~"**NO browser surface was built this pass** — story 06's three `@executable` tasks (00–02) delivered

## The data the current-work region renders (read-only, additive)

A thin projection of the presence aggregate — it carries no session logic of its own. Pinning the data
source (the m22/R6 "a mechanic must have a real data source" discipline):

- **`activeRuns`** — the frozen m23 field (`PresenceRecord.activeRuns: string[]`, `ui/src/fleet/api.ts`)
  — the in-flight run ids, **aggregated across all of the node's workspaces**. Non-empty ⇒
  `running N run(s)`. **Unchanged.**
- **The session signal** — an **ADDITIVE field alongside `activeRuns`** on the presence record (the
  architect fixes its exact wire shape in `ARCHITECTURE.md`; design against the **concept**: a node's set
  of **live coding-assistant sessions**, each naming the **workspace/repo** it is open on, already
  TTL-filtered by the presence publisher so the card only ever sees live ones).
- **Reconciliation is PER-WORKSPACE (corrected — §Correction 2).** Within a workspace, a running task-run
  **subsumes that workspace's session** (the run is the stronger claim about the *same* work). Sessions in
  workspaces **without** a run are **NOT suppressed** — they still render, on their own line. This
  consumes the ARCHITECTURE reconciliation verdict (SPEC open question "session ↔ run reconciliation");
  the design's job is only to say how it reads.
  > ~~"When a node has both a running task-run AND a live session, the run wins the line — it reads
  > `running N runs`, not the session."~~ — **WRONG, corrected 2026-07-12.** That is per-NODE. It would
  > hide real work.
- **Workspace `work_dir` is resolved ABSOLUTE.** (F11: a relative `work_dir` made the aggregate re-read
  ONE workspace N times — one run rendered `running 2 runs`, and every cross-workspace session was
  silently destroyed.) The correctness of this whole region depends on it. Behaviour/ARCHITECTURE, noted
  here because the design is unrenderable without it.
- The card **writes none of it.** The only facts are rendered; there is no interaction added.

## Surface 1 — the current-work region — the one changed region, on TWO real surfaces

**One design rule, two implementations**, because the two surfaces are written in two languages. Both are
conformance surfaces. Both are judged.

### The shared rule (governs BOTH surfaces — this is the binding part)

| # | Binding rule | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **S1** | **The current-work region is a bounded STACK of 1–2 lines** — an optional `running N run(s)` line, then an optional `working · <repos> (session)` line. If neither: **exactly one** `idle` line. Never zero lines, never three. *(corrected — §Correction 2)* | |
| **S2** | **Exact label.** Prefix `working · ` (the middle-dot separator the surface already uses), then the repo **short name**(s), then a **single** trailing ` (session)` qualifier | |
| **S3** | **Token.** Active work — **running OR working-session** — is **`primary`** (`font-semibold text-primary`, or the desktop's equivalent active token). No work — `idle`, including the stale-expired fallback — is **`muted`**. **`working` is the PEER of `running`: identical weight, identical colour.** | |
| **S4** | **Colour AND label always travel together.** The state is never signalled by colour alone; the labels are distinct and the token only reinforces active-vs-quiet | m25 rail |
| **S5** | **No new primitive.** NO session-specific colour, dot, chip, badge, icon, accent, background, or pill. The session state is **plain text in the existing region**, in the existing tokens | **load-bearing** |
| **S6** | **All un-subsumed repos show on ONE session line** — comma-joined under **one** `working ·` prefix and **one** trailing `(session)`. **Order is deterministic: alphabetical by repo short name** (an unstable order makes the line reshuffle between polls and any snapshot test flaky). Trailing truncation on a narrow card is acceptable (same idiom as the capability footer). *(order rule added — §Correction 2)* | |
| **S7** | **Run wins its OWN WORKSPACE.** A run subsumes the session **of the same workspace** — that session does not render. Sessions in **other** workspaces still render on the session line. A node may therefore show a run line AND a session line together. *(corrected — §Correction 2)* | ARCHITECTURE |
| **S8** | **Expired session ⇒ `idle`, never a stuck `working`.** The aggregate TTL-filters; the surface renders only what it is handed and shows no "was working" ghost — **even while a dead session record still sits on disk** | |
| **S9** | **Bounded growth, row integrity preserved.** The region may grow from one line to two; the card grows with it and the grid stretches its siblings to equal height, so the **row** stays clean and the footer stays anchored by its top border. The region is **capped at two lines by construction** (runs collapse to one line, sessions to one) — it can never grow unboundedly with workspace count. *(corrected — §Correction 2)* | |
| **S10** | **ONE rule, N implementations, IDENTICAL string.** JS `fleetCurrentWorkLines()` and Rust `current_work()`/`display()` **must render the identical string for the identical payload.** A Rust app cannot import a JS projection, so the rule is duplicated by necessity — the *duplication is permitted, the divergence is not.* **Enforced by contract test, not by screenshot** (`test/arch/acd-captured-producer-fixture.test.mjs`) | |
| **S11** | **Reconciliation is PER-WORKSPACE, never per-node.** Work is a property of a *workspace*, not of a *machine*. The region must never suppress real work in workspace B because workspace A has a run | **new — §Correction 2** |

RATIONALE for **S5** (the rule the review exists to enforce): a dot/badge here would invent a fleet-local
**session vocabulary** and risk being read as a *fourth* ramp. The region is already plain text lines
(`idle` / `running N runs`); the honest, in-idiom move is a **third label in the same region**, not a new
primitive. The fleet's three-ramp discipline (node-liveness · run-state · item-status-one-level-down)
must survive this milestone intact.

RATIONALE for **S10**: the same fact now renders from two codebases. If they drift, the fleet tells two
different truths about one node depending on which window you look at. The strings are the contract — and
a string contract is checked by a **test**, not by a human squinting at two screenshots.

RATIONALE for **S11**: see §Correction 2. Suppressing a cross-workspace session to honour a node-level
rule is the same lie (`idle` while a human is working) the milestone was opened to kill.

---

### Surface 1a — WEB · the `GlobalNodePanel` node card

**Governs:** the web app at `?mode=fleet` in **both** `scope=global` and `scope=local` — this card is
what production mounts in every scope (§Correction 1). **Component:** `GlobalNodePanel`,
`ui/src/fleet/Fleet.tsx:537`.

**The card's real anatomy — SIX regions, in order** (this is what a reviewer ticks against):

1. **Identity line** — presence **dot** + mono `nodeId` + **role badge** (`WORKER` / `CONTROL`). *Carried forward verbatim.*
2. **Host line** — the machine host (`Umamis-MSI`, `Umamis-Mac-mini.local`). *Carried forward verbatim.*
3. **Presence-age line** — `last seen Nd ago` / `never seen`. *Carried forward verbatim.* (**Node liveness** — a separate ramp from current-work; the two must never merge. Its vocabulary differs from the m25 `PresenceLabel` ramp; see **DG-1** — not m38's to fix.)
4. **CURRENT-WORK REGION — THE CHANGED REGION.** **1–2 text lines**, `text-[13px]`, same typographic slot. Renders via `nodeCurrentWork(node)` → **`fleetCurrentWorkLines(node.presence ?? {})`** (*plural — see §Correction 2*). Judged against **S1–S11** and the States table.
5. **Fabric line** — `fabric addr: …`. *Carried forward verbatim.* (Sits one line lower when the region shows two lines — **expected**, see S9.)
6. **Capabilities footer** — `claude, codex` / `no capabilities`, over a top border. *Carried forward verbatim.* (Phrasing differs from the other card's; see **DG-1**.)

> ~~"the NodeCard keeps its four-row anatomy exactly: Row 1 identity (… `this node` tag + `aofVersion`
> chip) · Row 2 presence-age (dot `md` + `PresenceLabel`: `♥ Ns` / `stale · Nm` / `no presence`) · Row 3
> current-work · Row 4 capability footer (`runtimes · N skills`)."~~ — **WRONG, corrected 2026-07-12.**
> That is `NodeCard`'s anatomy, and `NodeCard` never renders (§Correction 1). A reviewer handed the real
> card and this list will tick **four rows against six** and return a false CONFORMS. **It did.**

---

### Surface 1b — DESKTOP · the Rust/Tauri node row

**Governs:** the desktop app (`app/desktop/`). **It is NOT React** — a Rust/Tauri app rendering its own
node rows from `app/desktop/crates/core/src/view_model.rs` (`current_work()` → `display()`).
**This surface was absent from this design entirely until 2026-07-12** — a whole rendering surface, in a
different language, invisible to the doc. It is also the surface whose own UAT raised the milestone's bug
(F7/F8). *A design that cannot see a surface cannot govern it.*

**The row's real anatomy, in order:** presence dot → `nodeId` → `this node` chip → role badge → version →
**CURRENT-WORK LABEL (the changed region)**. All but the last are *carried forward verbatim*.

Judged against **S1–S11**, and against **S10** specifically: it must emit the **byte-identical string** the
web emits for the same payload. **S10 is verified by contract test, not by screenshot** — see §Review status.

---

### States (the current-work region — the milestone's state set, BOTH surfaces)

The generic UI-state axis (empty / loading / error / populated) is owned surface-wide by m25 DESIGN
§Surface-1 States and is **unchanged**. What this milestone adds is the **populated state set for the
current-work region**:

| State | Region reads | Token | When |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **idle** | `idle` | `muted` | no active runs AND no live session. **Unchanged baseline.** |
| **running** | `running N run(s)` | `primary` | ≥1 running task-run. Correctly pluralised (`running 1 run`). **Unchanged baseline.** |
| **working-session** | `working · <repo> (session)` | `primary` | ≥1 live session, no run in that workspace. **NEW.** |
| **two-repos** | `working · repoA, repoB (session)` | `primary` | live sessions in ≥2 workspaces without runs. One `working ·` prefix, comma-joined, **alphabetical**, `(session)` **once**. **NEW.** |
| **run + cross-workspace session** | TWO lines: `running N run(s)` **over** `working · <repo> (session)` | both `primary` | a run in workspace A **and** a live session in workspace B. A's own session is subsumed; B's renders. The run line reads **first**. **NEW.** |
| **stale-expired** | `idle` | `muted` | a session past its TTL. Dropped by the aggregate before the surface sees it — **never a stuck `working`**, no ghost, **even while the dead session record is still on disk.** |

Notes binding the review:
- **The `working` prefix is fixed:** `working · ` (the middle-dot the fleet already uses — region
  summaries `N nodes · N live`, the diagnostics strip), then the repo name(s), then ` (session)`.
- **The repo renders as its SHORT NAME** (`aof`, `pilot-app-portal` — not a path, not a slug).
  > ~~"the repo's short name **(mono-adjacent identity)**"~~ — **clarified 2026-07-12.** That parenthetical
  > was being read as a *font* binding. **It is not.** It is the rationale for choosing the short name. The
  > region is **one token, one font** (S3/S5) — a mono span inside it would itself be a new typographic
  > primitive and is **forbidden**. The current render is **CORRECT**.
- **working is a PEER of running** — same `primary` emphasis, same weight, same colour. **Proven in
  FRAME A**, both labels in one card, one image. Not asserted: witnessed.

### Design ramp for the changed region

Draws from the **run-state ramp's tokens already in play** — it invents nothing:
- **active work (running OR working-session) = `primary`** — the same token `running N runs` already uses.
- **no work (idle, incl. stale-expired fallback) = `muted`** — the same token `idle` already uses.
- **Colour AND label always travel together** — never colour alone (S4).
- **No new dot, chip, badge, icon, or accent for the session** (S5). The node-presence ramp and the
  run-state ramp stay their own primitives. **The review flags any session-specific primitive as a gap.**

---

## Surface 2 — the work-item card's "assign to node" affordance (NEW — story 04, 2026-07-18)

**This is the milestone's first MUTATION affordance and the conformance baseline for story 04.** Authored
2026-07-18; it did not exist before this pass. `aof:verify 38` judges the assign affordance **region-by-region
against A1–A11 and the affordance States table** below. **There is no mock** (binding-checklist-only, as
§Surface 1). Judged 2026-07-24 against TWO REAL-assign renders — the first, and the re-render taken after the
DG-13/DG-14 build — **GAPS at 1280** in both (see Review status).

**Governs:** the web app at `?mode=fleet` (global scope), the **work-item (milestone) card** —
`FleetMilestoneCard`, `ui/src/fleet/Fleet.tsx`. **This is NOT §Surface 1's node card.** §Surface 1 governs
the `GlobalNodePanel` node card and its current-work region; the assign affordance lives on the *work-item*
card in the milestone list. The two are different cards, so the affordance does **not** crowd the
current-work region directly — its crowding risk is on the **work-item card's own anatomy** (see **DG-3**).

**The binding rail this DELIBERATELY carves out:** m25 / §Surface-1 pinned a **read-only** rail — "the
surface renders, it never mutates." Story 04 (ADR-012) is the **sanctioned single exception**: ONE write
route, ONE affordance. The design consequence is a constraint, not a licence — **the affordance must read as
a QUIET, subordinate carve-out on a surface that is still a monitor first**, never turning the board into a
control panel (A2).

### The work-item card's anatomy — SIX regions, in order (what a reviewer ticks against)

1. **Identity line** — `StatusRing` + mono `ref` + `milestone` type tag + right-aligned `StatusChip`. *Carried forward verbatim.*
2. **Title** — the item title (`h3`). *Carried forward verbatim.*
3. **Progress row + track** — `<label> · done/total` + the progress bar. *Carried forward verbatim.*
4. **Story dots + count** — the per-story status dots and `N stories`. *Carried forward verbatim.*
5. **Footer** (top-bordered) — mono workspace name · **attention cluster** · right-aligned `Open board →`. The **attention cluster is where the resulting `assigned` chip appears** (the m35/story-03 `AssignmentChip`), NOT in the affordance row. *Carried forward; the chip is the m35 ramp, unchanged.*
6. **ASSIGN AFFORDANCE ROW — THE NEW REGION.** A top-bordered row at the card FOOT, a **sibling BELOW** the Open-board button (never nested inside it): the **worker-node picker** (`<select>`), the **`Assign →` action**, and an **inline error slot**. Fed by `assignableNodeOptions(nodes)` (`ui/src/fleet/scope.mjs`) → `fleetApi.assign` (`ui/src/fleet/api.ts`). Judged against **A1–A11**.

> **Addendum 2026-07-23 (story 06 / task 04).** The work-item card now has a **SEVENTH** region: §Surface 3's
> **read-only terminal-VIEW**, mounted as a further sibling **below** the assign affordance row
> (`Fleet.tsx` — `<AssignAffordance/>` then `<FleetTerminalView/>`). **A1's phrase "at the card FOOT" is
> therefore superseded**: the affordance is still a *sibling below the Open-board button and outside its
> clickable region* (A1's intent, unchanged and still binding), but it is no longer the last thing on the
> card. Confirmed in the 1280px renders of 2026-07-23. A1 is otherwise unchanged.

### The binding rules (A1–A11)

| # | Binding rule | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **A1** | **Placement — its own row at the card FOOT, below the Open-board footer, on its own `border-t` divider.** The affordance is a **sibling** of the Open-board button, never nested inside it (an HTML `<button>` may not nest an interactive control). All five carried-forward regions render **verbatim**; the affordance adds height, it never displaces them. *("at the card FOOT" superseded 2026-07-23 — the terminal-view sits below it; the sibling/outside-the-button rule stands.)* | |
| **A2** | **Quiet, subordinate carve-out — the surface stays a monitor.** At rest the **picker is in the `muted` ramp** (`bg-muted`, `text-muted-foreground`); only the **action** carries a **LOW-emphasis `primary` tint** (primary text on a `primary/10` fill, `primary/40` border) — enough to be found, not a solid filled button that shouts on every card. The read-only rail is carved out by ONE affordance, not overturned. | **load-bearing** |
| **A3** | **Producer-fed picker — exactly the assignable roster.** Options are exactly the roster's node ids (`assignableNodeOptions`) — **no invented `any`/placeholder target, no dropped known node.** A stale-but-known node stays an option (the verb keys on membership, not liveness). *(the DATA is task 03's; the RULE "the picker shows exactly the assignable roster" is the design's checkable contract.)* | task 03 |
| **A4** | **Empty roster ⇒ DISABLED, not hidden, not phantom.** No worker node ⇒ the picker renders **disabled** with a single honest placeholder (`No worker nodes yet`) and the action **disabled**. Never a selectable option, never an invented `any` target, never a blank/crash. This is the affordance's own empty state. | |
| **A5** | **One node ⇒ preselected, still a picker.** A single-node roster preselects that node but stays a picker (not collapsed to static text) so the operator SEES the target before committing. | |
| **A6** | **Many nodes (live + stale) ⇒ all known nodes are options**, first preselected, deterministic order. Liveness does not filter the picker; it **should annotate** the option so the choice is informed — today it does not (**DG-5**, deferred, the open half of this rule). | |
| **A7** | **The action's transient states are all rendered — INCLUDING the SUCCESS path.** `Assign →` (at rest) → `Assigning…` (disabled, in flight) → on a 2xx the SAME button reads **`Sent`** — `muted`, disabled, the picker **frozen on the chosen node** — **held 5s (one poll interval), then the row returns to rest**. The button never passes back through `Assign →` between `Assigning…` and `Sent` (a local POST returns in milliseconds, so `Assigning…` alone is NOT an acknowledgment — it may be sub-perceptual). The transient reports **the CALL, never the assignment's state**: the lifecycle stays region 5's (A8). On a verb gate-miss an **inline `destructive` error** renders in the affordance row (no hold; the action re-enables at once) — never a silent no-op, never a 200-plus-phantom. A POST that never answers is a **REFUSAL, not a limbo**: it times out at **10s (2 × POLL_MS)** into the `refused` state — see Amendment 2026-07-24 (b). *(success path amended 2026-07-24 — F22, live soak. Was: "on success **no local chip**".)* | ADR-012 |
| **A8** | **The result is the m35/story-03 chip, VERBATIM — no new assign-result vocabulary — and it must ARRIVE PROMPTLY.** The `assigned` confirmation is the existing `AssignmentChip` (`assigned` = **`muted` + a hollow dot + `→ <targetNodeId>`**), climbing the m35 §4 assignment ramp (assigned→accepted→running→done/failed). **On a 2xx the surface fires exactly ONE additional SILENT keep-last-good re-load** (the same load the ⟳ control triggers) so the chip lands within a round trip instead of up to 5s later; the 5s poll remains the steady state — no second cadence, no retry ladder. The affordance still mints **no chip, badge, toast, or accent of its own** — A7's `Sent` is a **state of the affordance's OWN control**, not a second vocabulary, and the boundary is exact: it lives in **region 6 only**, it **decays inside one poll interval**, it carries **no mark, colour or shape**, and it **never claims the assignment's STATE**. *(amended 2026-07-24 — F22, live soak.)* | m35 §4 |
| **A9** | **No new colour primitive.** The affordance uses ONLY existing theme tokens — `muted` (picker, and the `Sent` acknowledgment), a `primary` tint (action at rest), `destructive` (inline error) — the same tokens the card and the assignment ramp already speak. No fleet-local palette, no hex, no "assignable" accent, no success green. | mirrors S5 |
| **A10** | **Spacing/rhythm native to the card.** The row reuses the card's divider+padding idiom (`border-t border-border pt-3`, `mt-3`, `gap-2`, `text-xs`) — the SAME rhythm the footer uses — so it reads as a native region, not a bolted-on widget. **No state of the row may change its height or its rhythm** — the acknowledgment is a label swap inside the existing control, nothing more. **"Rhythm" is binding geometry:** the action reserves a constant width sized to its longest label (`Assigning…`) in every state, and the picker keeps a floor of ≥14ch + chevron. **No state may collapse the picker or move the action** — the message slot is the element that yields. *(bound 2026-07-24 — F-38.04g / DG-13.)* | |
| **A11** | **Click isolation reads visually.** The affordance's controls must not trigger the card's Open-board navigation (they stop propagation), and must read as **clearly OUTSIDE** the Open-board clickable region (below its border) so the picker is never mistaken for part of the drill-in. | |

> **DECISION — BOTH treatments, because they do two different jobs.**
> **(a) The real chip arrives IMMEDIATELY** — on a 2xx the surface re-loads once, silently, so region 5's
> m35 chip lands within a round trip instead of up to 5s later (A8). **(b) The affordance acknowledges the

> chosen node, for 5s, then the row returns to rest (A7). Nothing is minted: no chip, no badge, no toast,
> no accent, no token outside A9's three.
>
> **Why not (a) alone** (the pure-A8 answer — change nothing visual, just make the chip fast): it puts the
> entire acknowledgment in the region the operator is NOT looking at (region 5, *above* the click target),
> in the QUIETEST token on the card (`assigned` = muted + hollow dot), on a surface where things change by
> themselves every five seconds. A muted chip quietly appearing two regions up is indistinguishable from
> routine poll churn. It also fails badly whenever the re-load is late, silently unsuccessful
> (keep-last-good swallows it) or the record has not yet landed — which returns the operator to the soak's
> exact experience.
>
> **Why not (b) alone** (a transient in region 6, chip left to the 5s poll): the operator would learn the
> outcome from the BUTTON and stop reading region 5 — which is precisely how a second vocabulary takes
> root (§Surface 1 S5's fourth-ramp mistake; A8's rail). The transient is only safe **because** a durable
> chip follows it promptly. Without (a) it silently becomes the confirmation.
>
> **Why `Sent` and not `Assigned`.** `assigned` is the m35 ramp's word for a STATE of the assignment; a
> button that also says "assigned" is a second utterance of ONE fact — exactly what A8 forbids. `Sent` is
> a **different fact that no other region reports**: *the route accepted your request.* It therefore cannot

> vocabulary. (`✓` is likewise not borrowed: it is the m35 ramp's mark for `done`.)
>
> **Why 5 seconds.** It is one poll interval (`POLL_MS`, `ui/src/fleet/Fleet.tsx`). The worst case for the
> next scheduled poll landing after a click is exactly one interval, so a 5s hold guarantees there is
> **never a moment between the click and a confirmation in which the surface says nothing** — even if the

>
> **The mechanism, precisely (so no second round-trip is needed to build it):**
> - **Region 6 · the affordance row.** On a 2xx the `<select>` stays **disabled with the chosen node still
>   selected** — so the row reads `Sent` beside `umamis-mac-mini` and the target is named **for free**,
>   nothing is added to say it — and the SAME `<button>` reads **`Sent`** in the `muted` ramp: the
>   `primary/10` fill, `primary/40` border and `text-primary` are **DROPPED, not added to.** The
>   acknowledgment is the **quietest state the row ever renders**. No mark, no glyph, no toast, no motion,
>   no height change, same type and rhythm (A10).
> - **No gap, no flicker.** `Assign →` → `Assigning…` → `Sent`, never returning to `Assign →` in between.
> - **Duration 5s, then the TERMINAL RESTING STATE:** picker enabled, **the same node still selected**
>   (nothing resets), `Assign →` back in its low-emphasis `primary` tint, message slot empty. **Nothing of
>   the acknowledgment persists.** The durable record is region 5's chip and only that.
> - **Region 5 · the footer attention cluster.** Unchanged in vocabulary and placement — but it must be
>   REACHED promptly: on a 2xx the surface fires **exactly one** additional **silent, keep-last-good**
>   re-load, the same one the ⟳ control triggers (`load(scope, { silent: true })`, `Fleet.tsx`), handed
>   down to the affordance as an `onAssigned` callback. **It must be the SILENT load** — a non-silent load
>   flips the page into its loading state and unmounts the board, which is a far worse answer than saying
>   nothing — and it is **one** load, not a new cadence and not a retry ladder. If the record is not yet
>   visible, the existing 5s poll picks it up; that is the window the `Sent` hold is sized to cover. *(This
>   is a data-TIMING decision the design is taking deliberately, because the operator's confidence in a
>   mutation depends on it.)*
> - **The failure legs, placed where they belong.** A **refused POST** (verb gate-miss, transport) is
>   unchanged: inline `destructive` in region 6, action re-enabled at once, **no hold, no `Sent`**. A
>   **lifecycle failure after a successful dispatch** (`assigned → failed`, incl. `· reclaimed`) belongs to
>   **region 5's m35 chip alone** — the affordance never mirrors it. A spent control must not re-report a
>   lifecycle it no longer owns; that would be the second vocabulary by another route.
> - **If no chip appears by the end of the window, the surface is telling the truth** — nothing was
>   assigned to *this* item (the F21 mis-target class). The affordance must **not** paper over that with a
>   persistent "assigned" claim. The missing chip is the evidence.
>
> **What the eventual render must capture** (so this amendment is judgeable, not merely intended). Per the

> never a hand-seeded assignment record: the claim here is about the **click → confirmation** path, and a
> seeded fixture cannot exhibit it — it would judge the chrome and never the feature.
> 1. **t < 5s after a real click** — region 6 shows `Sent`, muted, disabled, picker frozen on the target.
> 2. **the same card after the success re-load** — region 5 carries the m35 `assigned` chip `→ <node>`.
> 3. **t > 5s** — region 6 back at rest, `Assign →` in its `primary` tint, selection preserved, nothing
>    left over, card height unchanged throughout.
> 4. **a refused assign** — inline `destructive` in region 6, no `Sent`, no hold.

> This **ADDS** to what §Surface 2's render owes. **The Review-status verdict is untouched and stays

> **DG-13 (F-38.04g) — geometry: the row may not go anonymous.** In the refused frame the picker

> the `Sent` label swap and the picker absorbs the difference, so the row reflows on every state change. Five
> binding clauses:
> 1. **The action's width is FIXED**, sized to its longest label (`Assigning…`), in every state including
>    disabled. **A label swap may not move another element.** That is what A10's "or its rhythm" means.
> 2. **The picker has a FLOOR and never yields to the message** — a minimum width rendering ≥14ch of the node
>    id plus the chevron. **A picker collapsed to a bare chevron is FORBIDDEN**: a control the operator must
>    re-aim may not be anonymous at the moment they re-aim it.
> 3. **The message slot is the element that yields** — it takes what is left, truncates, and carries the full
>    text in its native `title` (the idiom DG-10 already uses for the session id).
> 4. **The message may not re-state what the card already says.** `Item "18" already has an active
>    assignment …` spends its width on the ref (region 1) and truncates away the only fact no other region
>    carries — the holder. Copy priority: **outcome > holder > all else**, e.g. `already assigned →
>    umamis-mac-mini`.
> 5. **Region 5 width priority: chip label + `→ <target>` in FULL > `Open board →` > the workspace name.** The
>    workspace name yields first (it is already in the workspaces strip); the target id truncates **last**, and
>    if it still cannot render in full the workspace name is **dropped**, not the id. **A target that cannot be
>    read is a chip that has not spoken.**
>
> **DG-14 (F-38.04f) — a hung POST is a REFUSAL, not a limbo.** `runAssign` awaits with no timeout and only
> `sent` schedules a decay, so a POST that never answers holds `Assigning…` **forever** — picker frozen, action
> disabled, no error, recoverable only by reloading the page. It lands in the existing `refused` state reusing
> `destructive` — no new vocabulary — with one correction to the obvious copy:
> 1. **Timeout = 10s = 2 × `POLL_MS`** — derived from the one constant the surface already speaks in (the
>    `Sent` hold is 1 × `POLL_MS` for the same reason). One interval is too eager for a cross-machine POST; two
>    is past the point any answer is still useful.
> 2. **At t=10s the row reads the existing `refused` presentation VERBATIM** — picker re-enabled with the
>    selection kept, action back to `Assign →` in its `primary` tint, inline `destructive` message. No `Sent`,
>    no hold.
> 3. **Copy: `no answer — timed out`.** NOT "not sent", NOT "failed to assign" — **a timed-out POST may have
>    succeeded server-side.** The affordance reports the CALL (A7); region 5 stays the sole authority on whether
>    anything was assigned, and the 5s poll keeps running underneath, so the chip appears on its own if the
>    record landed. Same discipline as the "no chip by the end of the window" row.
> 4. **Resting state:** the message stands until the next attempt; re-click is permitted. If the dispatch DID
>    land, the re-click draws the ordinary `already assigned → <node>` refusal — a correct answer, not a new
>    failure mode.
> 5. **A late 2xx is TERMINAL for the affordance** — it must not resurrect `Sent` or clear the error
>    (`destructive` and `Sent` may never co-exist). It is honoured only by firing A8's one silent
>    keep-last-good re-load so region 5 gets its chip. A late non-2xx changes nothing.

### States (the assign affordance's own state axis — the story-04 state set)

| State | Picker | Action | When |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **empty-roster** | disabled · `No worker nodes yet` · muted | disabled | roster carries no worker node |
| **one-node** | single node preselected · muted | enabled `Assign →` | exactly one node |
| **many-nodes (live + stale)** | all known nodes · first preselected · muted | enabled `Assign →` | ≥2 nodes; stale nodes still offered |
| **assigning** | selection frozen · disabled | `Assigning…` · disabled | POST in flight. **Sub-perceptual on a local POST (milliseconds)** — an honest state for a slow/cross-machine call, but **never the acknowledgment**; it flows straight into **sent** without returning to rest. *(amended 2026-07-24 — F22)* |
| **sent (LOCAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT — TRANSIENT)** | selection frozen **on the chosen node** · disabled (so the row reads `Sent` beside the target — it is named for free) | **`Sent`** · disabled · **`muted`** (the `primary` tint is DROPPED — the action has spent itself). No mark, no glyph, no motion, no height change | the POST returned 2xx. **Held 5s (= one poll interval, `POLL_MS`), then the row returns to rest**: picker enabled, same node still selected, `Assign →` back in its `primary` tint, message slot empty. **Nothing persists.** *(NEW 2026-07-24 — F22)* |
| **refused** | selection kept | `Assign →` re-enabled + **inline `destructive` error** | verb gate-miss (unknown/ineligible node, already-active, unresolvable ref) — or transport failure. **No hold, no `Sent`;** the error stands until the next attempt. *(clarified 2026-07-24 — F22)* |
| **timed out (no answer) — a leg of `refused`** | selection kept · re-enabled | `Assign →` re-enabled + inline `destructive` **`no answer — timed out`** | the POST has not answered after **10s (2 × POLL_MS)**. No `Sent`, no hold. The copy reports the **CALL only** — it never claims nothing was assigned; region 5's chip remains the sole authority and the 5s poll still runs. A late 2xx must not resurrect `Sent`; it fires A8's one silent re-load and nothing else. *(NEW 2026-07-24 — F-38.04f)* |
| **assigned (CONFIRMATION — region 5, DURABLE)** | *(at rest)* | *(at rest)* | the **success re-load** (A8 — within a round trip of the 2xx), or the next 5s poll if that misses, lands the record and region 5's footer attention cluster renders the m35 `assigned` chip (muted, hollow dot, `→ <node>`). **This — not the transient — is the record of the assignment.** *(amended 2026-07-24 — F22; was "after the 5s poll")* |
| **lifecycle change / failure (region 5, DURABLE)** | *(at rest)* | *(at rest)* | after dispatch the assignment climbs or falls the m35 ramp (`accepted` → `running` → `done`, or **`failed`** = `destructive` + `!`, incl. `· reclaimed`). **Region 5 speaks it alone; the affordance never mirrors it** — a spent control must not re-report a lifecycle it no longer owns. *(NEW 2026-07-24 — F22: the triage's `failed` leg, placed where it belongs)* |
| **no chip by the end of the window** | *(at rest)* | *(at rest)* | a 2xx whose record never appears on THIS card. The surface is being **truthful** — nothing was assigned to this item (the F21 mis-target class). The affordance must not mask it with a persistent "assigned" claim; **the missing chip is the evidence.** *(NEW 2026-07-24 — F22)* |

### Design ramp for the affordance

- **picker at rest = `muted`** — the surface is a monitor first; the control is quiet until engaged.
- **action = LOW-emphasis `primary` tint** — found, not shouting; never a solid filled primary on every card.
- **in-flight = disabled + `Assigning…`** — the action states itself; no spinner primitive is invented.
- **acknowledged (success) = disabled + `Sent`, `muted`, 5s, then gone** — the tint is **dropped, not
  added**: the quietest state the row ever renders, reporting the CALL and decaying inside one poll
  interval. No mark, no glyph, no toast, no motion. *(2026-07-24 — F22.)*
- **error = `destructive`, inline** — the same token every fleet read-failure uses.
- **result = the m35 assignment ramp, verbatim** (`assigned` = muted hollow dot). **The review flags any
  assign-result-specific primitive (badge / toast / accent) as a gap.**

### RATIONALE

- **Why a `<select>`, not a radio group or an always-expanded list:** the affordance sits on **every**
  milestone card and the roster is 0..N nodes. A `<select>` shows the full option set **on demand** in one
  row; a radio group would multiply each card's height by the roster size, permanently, on a dense board.
  The dropdown is the compact, in-idiom control — the picker earns its one row, no more.
- **Why quiet-at-rest (A2):** the read-only rail is a m25 binding rail; the fleet reads as a **monitor**. A
  solid primary button on every card converts the monitor into a control panel and invites mis-clicks on a
  scanning surface. The carve-out is deliberately **present but subordinate.**
- **Why the result reuses the m35 chip (A8):** the assignment lifecycle already owns a ramp. A fresh
  "just assigned" badge would be a **second vocabulary for one fact** — the very fourth-ramp mistake
  §Surface 1 S5 exists to prevent. One assignment ramp, spoken once.
- **Why the affordance may nonetheless say `Sent` (2026-07-24 — F22):** A8 forbids a second **vocabulary
  for one fact**, not an acknowledgment. `assigned` is the ramp's word for the assignment's STATE; `Sent`
  is the affordance's word for the CALL — a different fact, reported by no other region, confined to
  region 6, decaying inside one poll interval, carrying no mark or colour of its own. The live soak proved
  the alternative: on a passive monitor an unanswered click reads as a click that did nothing. See the
  Amendment above.

### Review status — Surface 2 — **CONFORMS on region 6; region 5 CLOSED at the FOURTH pass (2026-07-24)**

**Judged four times in one day, each on a fresh producer-fed render.** The surface converged: verdict 1 **GAPS**
(DG-13, DG-14, GAP-S2-3) → verdict 2 **GAPS** (DG-15, DG-16, DG-17) → verdict 3 **GAPS** (DG-19, DG-20, DG-21) →
verdict 4 **GAPS, explicitly NON-BLOCKING**, with the designer's own recommendation: *"Nothing open blocks story
04's acceptance. Region 6 — the region story 04 actually builds — CONFORMS end to end for the first time: state
axis, geometry and copy."* The residues it left were then **built and re-rendered in the same session**; what
remains is recorded below.

**What closed, and where.** DG-13 c1–c3 (fixed action width, picker floor, message yields) and DG-14 (the
timed-out row) and GAP-S2-3 (the frozen picker's target) closed at verdict 2. DG-15 (the overprint), DG-16 (the
`l…` stub) and DG-17 (the truncated holder) closed at verdict 3. **DG-19, DG-20, DG-21 and DG-22 closed after
verdict 4** — built, re-rendered and witnessed:
- **DG-21** — every rung of the refusal ladder now names the OUTCOME (`refused · umamis-msi`), so the
  `destructive` tint is never the only thing distinguishing a refusal from region 5's `assigned → <same node>`.
- **DG-20** — the workspace name is gated on FIT, and the **discriminating frame was finally produced**
  (`09-DG20-short-name-with-chip`): the `aof` card carries a chip **and keeps its name**, while
  `lark-guard-portal` is dropped whole. The two candidate gates are no longer observationally identical.
- **DG-19** — the tail now DROPS whole instead of stubbing to `· just…`, `Open board →` degrades to its pinned
  `→`, and the row stays inside the card's content box.
- **DG-22** — the leading group is left-aligned once the name is dropped; only the drill-in is right-aligned.
- **c5.4 (the abbreviated arrow's tint) — CLOSED by measurement, not impression.** `getComputedStyle` reads
  `rgb(19, 118, 109)` for the arrow at BOTH its 78.7px full width and its 14px abbreviated width. The suspicion
  that the degraded arrow "reads greyer" was a downscaled-crop artifact; the tint is byte-identical.

**The methodological lesson this surface earned, and it is not a design lesson.** The yield order was first built
out of flex `shrink` factors — 1000000 : 1000 : 1, a ratio that on paper sends ~99.6% of any squeeze to the
lowest-priority element. **Measured, it did nothing of the kind:** the drill-in yielded 13.1px while the chip,
weighted 1, yielded 17.5px, so the protected target truncated anyway. **Flexbox distributes a squeeze; it cannot
express "this element goes away so that one can be whole."** A priority list written as shrink factors is a
*preference*; the rules in this section are *absolutes*. Every clause is therefore now a **discrete budgeted
drop** — the same instrument as region 6's copy ladder — with the shrink factors left underneath only as a
backstop. Two further defects were caught the same way and by the same means: `min-w-0` on the drill-in let its
pinned arrow escape the card's box, while NO min-width made `min-width:auto` resolve to its full content width so
it never yielded at all (fixed by an explicit arrow-sized floor — the picker-floor idiom one element to the
right); and `flex-1` on a KEPT workspace name made it GROW into the row's free space and squeeze the target,
which is c5 exactly backwards. **None of these three was visible in the markup; all three came off a
`getBoundingClientRect` ledger.** Reasoning about this row's layout was wrong every single time it was tried.

**Remaining, all recorded and none blocking:** **DG-18** (the chip's 6px card growth) and **DG-23** (the lone `·`
placeholder on chip-less cards — pre-existing, m35's footer idiom) stay **deferred**. Still **NOT ASSESSED** and
owed at `aof:verify 38`'s `@uat`: the one-node roster (A5), a zoom crop of the `assigned` chip's dot
(hollow-vs-filled), ladder rungs 1 and 3, a refusal whose holder differs from the picker's selection, the
`<select>` OPEN state, 390/768, the `Assigning…` → `Sent` no-flicker clause, DG-14 clause 5 (a late 2xx),
region 7, region 5's post-`assigned` lifecycle states, A11's behavioural half, and the `@manual` soak.

#### SUPERSEDED — the SECOND real verdict (2026-07-24) — kept, because it was true when written

~~**GAPS at 1280 (SECOND real verdict, 2026-07-24 — the DG-13/DG-14 re-render)**~~ — **SUPERSEDED by the third and
fourth verdicts above.** Its three findings (DG-15/16/17) were built and closed. Its text stands below.

### Review status — Surface 2 — ~~**GAPS at 1280 (SECOND real verdict, 2026-07-24 — the DG-13/DG-14 re-render)**~~

**Two of the three prior gaps are CLOSED outright; the third is closed in the substance it was filed on and
leaves three narrower successors.** **Region 6 — the affordance's own state axis — now CONFORMS end to end:**
the action's width is fixed, the picker never goes anonymous, the message is the element that yields, the hung
POST has a state, and the `Sent` acknowledgment names the node the operator actually chose. **Every remaining
divergence is a WIDTH-PRIORITY failure** — two in region 5 (**DG-15**, **DG-16**, both **BUILD defects against
rules that are right**) and one that is a rule of the designer's own which **does not fit the row it governs**
(**DG-17** — there, the rule is what must change, not the build). The verdict is therefore **GAPS at 1280**, on a
materially smaller surface than the first pass.

**Provenance of the judged re-render (this is what makes the verdict worth having).** **Thirteen frames at 1280
only** (§Surface 2's own recorded reason: 390/768 are effectively unrenderable for this page), from the **real
built `ui/dist`** rebuilt this session (`npm run ui:build` green — **post-DG-12, so these pixels are NOT void**),
served by the **real `serveMeshUi`** over an isolated global store with **two published workspaces**, driven by
**real synthetic clicks** producing **real `POST /api/mesh/assign` calls** that minted **real `global_assignments`
rows read back from the real store**. **Nothing is hand-seeded** — the condition Amendment (F22) set, and the
milestone's earned lesson, are satisfied again. The pointer is parked off-card before every capture, so no
`hover:` ramp contaminates a frame. The judged card is **`18 · Homedata Live Property Data` (workspace
`lark-guard-portal`)** — a card that does **not** belong to the daemon's own workspace, which is what makes the
F21 cross-check meaningful. Frames: `01-empty-roster` · `02-rest` (card+page) · `03-in-flight` ·
`04-sent-and-chip` · `04b-sent-both-cards` · `05-decayed-rest` · `06-refused` (card+page) · `07-timed-out`
(card+page) · `08-long-target-chip` (card+page). Measured off the same rendered tree: **action box 83.06px in all
eight states**; **row 360.66 × 38px in all eight**; picker 269.59 at rest/sending/sent/decayed, **124.66 under the
refusal**, 140.36 under the timeout; decay **5017 ms** ≈ 1 × POLL_MS; timeout **10057 ms** ≈ 2 × POLL_MS; exactly
**ONE** extra `/api/mesh/status` GET on success (0 → 1); the mint landed in the **clicked** workspace
(`b49723d46648025a`), not the daemon's own (`e0a472b259be2a7f`).

#### Region ledger (this pass)

| Region | Verdict | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1 · identity line** | **CONFORMS** | Every frame: `StatusRing` + mono `18` + `MILESTONE` tag + right-aligned `in-progress` chip. Unchanged across all eight affordance states. |
| **2 · title** | **CONFORMS** | `Homedata Live Property Data` (h3), unchanged in every state. |
| **3 · progress row + track** | **CONFORMS** | `stories done` · `2 / 4` + the track, unchanged. |
| **4 · story dots + count** | **CONFORMS** | Four dots + `4 stories`, unchanged. |
| **5 · footer / attention cluster** | **GAPS** | Vocabulary and placement conform (the m35 `assigned` muted pill, `→ <target>`, the `· just now` / `· 5s ago` tail), and **DG-13 c5's headline is MET — the target now renders in FULL**, including a 30-character id (04: `→ umamis-msi`; 08: `→ umamis-mac-mini-build-agent-02`). **F21 re-witnessed in pixels (04b):** two cards share `ref 18` and only the CLICKED one carries the chip. But the **yield mechanism** is broken twice: in 08 the full target **collides with `Open board →`** — the trailing `2` and the leading `O` occupy the same pixels and the chip's `· just now` tail is destroyed (**DG-15**); in 04/04b/05/06/07 the workspace name renders as a **1–3 glyph stub** (`l…` / `le…` / `let…`) instead of being dropped (**DG-16**). |
| **6 · assign affordance row** | **CONFORMS on its whole state axis · GAPS on ONE message clause** | A4/A6/A7 (all eight states) + A8/A9/A10 conform in real pixels. The single divergence: the refusal message still truncates before naming the holder — `already assigned → uma…` (**DG-17**). |
| **7 · terminal-view** | **NOT ASSESSED** | No assignment in these fixtures carries a `sessionId`, so **no panel renders** — which is the CORRECT behaviour (V12 / ADR-014 inv.4), but it means region 7 is not exercised. Not inferred either way. |

#### Rule ledger (this pass)

| Rule | Ruling | What I saw |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **A1** | **CONFORMS** | The row is its own `border-t` row **below** the footer, a sibling of `Open board →` and never nested in it; all five carried-forward regions render verbatim (02/06/07 pages). |
| **A2** | **CONFORMS** | Picker `bg-muted`, mono, quiet; action = primary text on a faint primary fill with a `primary/40` border, 11px semibold — boxed but not solid, found without shouting. **Observation, NOT a gap:** the boxed action still out-weighs the bare-text `Open board →` above it. That is **DG-3's `@uat` question**, unchanged from the first pass. |
| **A3** | **CONFORMS (the half a render can judge)** | Options are exactly `["build-box-01","umamis-mac-mini","umamis-msi"]` — precisely the three nodes the page's own NODES region lists. No invented `any`, no placeholder, no dropped node. The **OPEN** dropdown stays NOT ASSESSED (OS chrome). |
| **A4** | **CONFORMS** | Frame 01: picker disabled with the single honest placeholder `No worker nodes yet`, action disabled — **and still reserving its full 83.06px**, so DG-13 c1 holds in the disabled state too. No selectable option, no phantom target, no blank. |
| **A5** | **NOT ASSESSED** | No one-node-roster frame in this pass. Nothing in the DG-13/DG-14 build touches the one-node path; the first pass's CONFORMS is not disturbed, but it is not re-witnessed here either. |
| **A6** | **CONFORMS in letter** | 3-node roster; the **stale** `build-box-01` (hollow dot, `last seen 30m ago` in the NODES region) is still offered **and** is the preselected first option, in deterministic node-id order. Liveness does not filter. **DG-5 re-witnessed and still open:** the picker offers that stale node with **no cue at all**. |
| **A7** | **CONFORMS** | All four transient legs in real pixels: `Assign →` (02) → `Assigning…` disabled with the picker frozen (03) → **`Sent`** muted + disabled (04) → **rest after 5017 ms** (05). The refusal re-enables at once with **no hold and no `Sent`** (06). The hung POST **times out at 10057 ms into the existing `refused` presentation** (07). The `Assigning…` → `Sent` **no-flicker** clause stays NOT ASSESSED — two stills cannot witness it. |
| **A8** | **CONFORMS** | The result is the m35 `AssignmentChip` **verbatim** (`assigned`, muted pill, `→ <target>`) — the affordance mints **no** chip, badge, toast or accent of its own. **Exactly ONE extra `/api/mesh/status` GET fired on the 2xx (0 → 1)**: one silent keep-last-good re-load, **not** a new cadence and **not** a retry ladder — and the board never flipped into its loading state (the milestone list is intact in 04/04b). The chip's **dot hollow-vs-filled** is still below crop resolution — **NOT ASSESSED**, third pass running, still owed a zoom crop. |
| **A9** | **CONFORMS** | Tokens observed across thirteen frames: `muted` (picker at rest, and the `Sent` acknowledgment), a low-emphasis `primary` tint (action at rest), `destructive` (both inline messages), and the m35 muted pill. **No success green, no hex, no fleet-local accent, no new primitive.** |
| **A10** | **CONFORMS — both halves, height AND rhythm** | Height: the row is **38px** and the action **83.06px** in **all eight** measured states. Rhythm (the DG-13 amendment): the action's width is now **fixed to its longest label** and **no label swap moves another element** — witnessed side-by-side in ONE image (04b: the left card's `Sent` box and the right card's `Assign →` box are the same size). *(The CARD grows 6px when the chip lands — that is region 5's geometry, not the row's; recorded as **DG-18**, deferred.)* |
| **A11** | **CONFORMS in its VISUAL half** | The row sits below the footer's own divider, on its own bordered row, unmistakably outside the `Open board →` clickable region — a reader cannot mistake the picker for part of the drill-in. The behavioural half (stop-propagation) is **not a pixel fact**; it is a task scenario, not a fidelity verdict. |

#### States-table ledger (this pass)

| State | Ruling | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **empty-roster** | **CONFORMS** | 01 — disabled picker, `No worker nodes yet`, disabled action at full reserved width. |
| **one-node** | **NOT ASSESSED** | no frame in this pass. |
| **many-nodes (live + stale)** | **CONFORMS** | 02 / 06-page / 07-page — three nodes, the stale one offered and preselected, node-id order. |
| **assigning** | **CONFORMS** | 03 — picker frozen on `umamis-msi` + disabled, `Assigning…` + disabled, geometry unchanged. |
| **sent** | **CONFORMS — and load-bearing** | 04 / 04b — `Sent`, `muted` (the tint **dropped**, not added to), disabled, picker frozen. **The operator chose `umamis-msi`, which is NOT the alphabetical default `build-box-01`** — so "frozen on the CHOSEN node" is witnessed, not a coincidence of ordering. No mark, no glyph, no motion. |
| **refused** | **CONFORMS as a state** | 06 — selection kept and legible, `Assign →` re-enabled in its primary tint, inline `destructive`, no hold. *(Its message clause is DG-17.)* |
| **timed out (no answer)** | **CONFORMS** | 07 — copy **`no answer — timed out`** verbatim at a measured **10057 ms**, the existing `refused` presentation reused with **no new vocabulary**, selection kept, action re-enabled (re-click permitted), no `Sent`, no hold. Its `title` says the request **may still have succeeded** and names region 5 as the authority — exactly DG-14 c3's discipline. **Clause 5 (a LATE 2xx) NOT ASSESSED** — the held POST was never answered. |
| **assigned (region 5, durable)** | **CONFORMS in vocabulary, placement and TIMING · GAPS in width behaviour** | 04/05/06/07/08 — the chip lands within a round trip of the 2xx via the one silent re-load. Width behaviour: DG-15 / DG-16. |
| **lifecycle change / failure (region 5)** | **NOT ASSESSED** | no assignment left `assigned` in these frames. |
| **no chip by the end of the window** | **NOT ASSESSED as a state — but its healthy NEGATIVE is witnessed** | 04b: the daemon's own identically-refed card correctly carries **no** chip, because nothing was assigned to it. |

#### The three prior gaps — the verdict on each, judged from these pixels

- **GAP-S2-1 (→ DG-13) — CLOSED as filed; three narrower successors opened at its edges.**
  - **c1 (fixed action width) — CLOSED.** 83.06px in **all eight** states including disabled, and visible
    side-by-side in a single image (04b). A label swap no longer moves anything.
  - **c2 (picker floor · no bare chevron) — CLOSED on its forbidden condition.** The picker is **never** a bare
    chevron; under **both** message states it names `umamis-msi` in full with its chevron (06/07). At its
    narrowest — **124.66px** — it renders ≈14.8ch of the select's mono glyph plus the chevron, satisfying the
    ≥14ch floor. *(Its behaviour under a message longer than these two is **NOT ASSESSED**: no frame presses the
    picker below 124.66px, so I cannot tell whether that value is the floor or merely the remainder.)*
  - **c3 (the message is the element that yields) — CLOSED, and the arithmetic proves it.** Refused:
    124.66 + 83.06 + 136.94 + 16 = **360.66** — the picker sits at its floor while the message is clamped well
    below its ~173px natural width. Timed-out: 140.36 + 83.06 + 121.23 + 16 = **360.65** — the message takes its
    content width and the **picker** absorbs the remainder. Both messages carry the full text in a native `title`.
  - **c4 (copy priority) — CLOSED IN COPY, NOT IN PIXELS.** The string is exactly c4's form
    (`already assigned → umamis-msi`) and no longer spends its width restating the ref — but it still renders
    **`already assigned → uma…`**. → **DG-17**.
  - **c5 (region 5 names the target in full) — CLOSED ON ITS HEADLINE, BROKEN IN MECHANISM.** The target renders
    in FULL, including a 30-character id. But `Open board →` never yields, so the two **collide** (**DG-15**),
    and the workspace name **stubs** instead of dropping (**DG-16**).
- **GAP-S2-2 (→ DG-14) — CLOSED.** Clauses 1–4 all witnessed in frame 07: the 10s (2 × POLL_MS) timeout measured
  at 10057 ms, the existing `refused` presentation reused verbatim, the copy `no answer — timed out` (never "not
  sent"), and a resting state that permits re-click. The hung POST no longer wedges the row; the surface's most
  confusing possible state now has a described, rendered answer.
- **GAP-S2-3 — CLOSED.** Frame 04: the frozen picker reads `umamis-msi`, region 5's chip reads `→ umamis-msi`,
  and the real store row reads `target_node_id: umamis-msi` — **three independent readings, one node.** Frame 08
  repeats it on a second, longer target (`umamis-mac-mini-build-agent-02` in the picker AND the chip). In **both**
  the chosen node is not the alphabetical default, so the agreement cannot be an artefact of ordering. The target
  is **derived, not remembered**, and `Sent`'s warrant — "the target is named for free" — is honest again.

#### NEW findings from this pass

- **DG-15 · region 5 · a long target OVERPRINTS `Open board →`** — **BUILD defect against DG-13 c5. The rule is
  right and must NOT be amended to match the pixels.**
- **DG-16 · region 5 · the workspace name yields to a one-character stub instead of being dropped** — **BUILD
  defect against DG-11's already-recorded rule ("never a one-character stub") and DG-13 c5. Do not amend.**
- **DG-17 · region 6 · the refusal message truncates before naming the holder** — **the RULE is wrong against
  reality.** DG-13 c2's picker floor and c4's own exemplar copy cannot coexist in a 360.66px row; the developer
  implemented c4 exactly as written. The designer owns the tightened rule.
- **DG-18 · region 5 · a successful assign grows the card 6px and reflows its grid row** — small, deferred.

All four are recorded in full under **§Deferred design-gap findings**.

#### NOT ASSESSED — do not infer a verdict for any of these

The `<select>` in its **OPEN** state (a native dropdown is OS chrome, outside the page compositor — the option
set was verified textually instead, which is what A3 is judged on); **390 / 768** (§Surface 2's own recorded
reason); **A5 / the one-node roster** (no frame); the **`Assigning…` → `Sent` transition** (two stills cannot
witness the no-flicker clause); the m35 chip's **dot hollow-vs-filled** (still below crop resolution — A8's dot
is unjudged for a third pass and is owed a zoom crop); the **picker floor under a message longer than these two**
(no frame presses it below 124.66px, so 124.66 may be the floor or merely the remainder); **DG-14 clause 5** —
a LATE 2xx arriving after the timeout (the held POST was never answered, so none was delivered); **region 7**
(no resolvable `sessionId` in these fixtures); **region 5's lifecycle states** (`accepted` / `running` / `done` /
`failed` / `· reclaimed` — nothing left `assigned`); **A11's behavioural half** (stop-propagation is not a pixel
fact — it is a task scenario); the **full-board disclosure** question (two cards is not a board — DG-3); and the
**`@manual` outsider soak**.

#### What's owed now

- **The DG-15 / DG-16 / DG-17 fixes, then ONE more 1280 frame set** — it need only be three frames: the
  long-target chip (DG-15), any chip-bearing card at rest (DG-16), and the refusal (DG-17). Plus, still
  outstanding from the first pass, **a zoom crop of the `assigned` chip's dot** so A8's hollow-vs-filled clause
  can finally be judged.
- **A one-node-roster frame** (A5) whenever the next set is rendered — cheap, and it closes a NOT-ASSESSED.
- The **`@manual` outsider soak** (story-04 task 04) — a person assigns a REAL item to a REAL node in the REAL
  UI and confirms the chip — remains the human gate, closed at `aof:verify 38`.
- **The orchestration renders and hands the screenshots; the designer judges.** Running the browser is
  QA/orchestration's job, **not** the designer's.

#### SUPERSEDED — the FIRST real verdict (2026-07-24, first pass) — kept, because it was TRUE when written and the gaps it named have been acted on

~~**GAPS at 1280 (first real verdict, 2026-07-24, second pass).**~~ — **SUPERSEDED 2026-07-24 by the re-render
verdict above.** Its three gaps were decided as DESIGN rules (DG-13, DG-14) and one BUILD fix (GAP-S2-3), built as
story-04 tasks 06/07, and re-judged above. Its **"What's owed at `aof:verify`"** list below is **discharged except
for the `@manual` soak** — superseded by "What's owed now".

~~**INCONCLUSIVE — no render handed, and no baseline pre-existed this pass.** This checklist IS the baseline,
authored today; there is nothing to judge a screenshot against yet, and **no screenshot was handed** to this
pass. Per the ACD design-conformance contract the honest verdict is **INCONCLUSIVE**, and the remedy is to
**produce the render** and judge it region-by-region against **A1–A11 + the affordance States table** — NOT
to infer CONFORMS/GAPS from the component code. (Reading the code INFORMED this checklist and the DG findings
below; it is **not** a fidelity verdict.)~~ — **SUPERSEDED 2026-07-24, and KEPT: it was TRUE from 2026-07-18 to
2026-07-24, and the six days of INCONCLUSIVE are the discipline working. The remedy it named has been carried
out.**

**Provenance of the judged render (this is what makes the verdict worth having).** Twelve frames at **1280**,
from the **real built `ui/dist`** rebuilt **after** the DG-12 CSS fix (so unlike the 2026-07-23 pixels these are
**not void**), served by the **real `serveMeshUi`** over an isolated global store, driven by a **real click** →
a **real `POST /api/mesh/assign`** → a **real `global_assignments` row read back**. **No assignment record was
hand-seeded** — the condition Amendment (F22) set, and the milestone's earned lesson ("a design render built on
a hand-seeded fixture can only judge the CHROME, never the FEATURE") is therefore satisfied.

**Region ledger.** Regions 1–4 (identity / title / progress / story dots) **CONFORM** — carried forward verbatim
in all twelve frames. **Region 5 (footer / attention cluster) — GAPS:** vocabulary and placement conform (the
`assigned` muted pill; `failed` as `destructive` + `!`; and — the F21 fix in pixels — the chip on the **clicked
card only**, the daemon's own identically-refed card untouched), but **the target truncates in every frame that
has one** (`→ umamis-m…`, `→ aaa-firs…`). **Region 6 (the affordance row) — GAPS:** A4/A5/A6/A7-states/A8/A9 all
conform; the **geometry** does not, and one frame names the wrong target.

**Rule ledger.** **A1, A3, A4, A5, A8, A9, A11 CONFORM.** **A2 CONFORMS post-DG-12** (picker `bg-muted` mono;
action = primary text on a faint primary fill, `primary/40` border, 11px semibold) — with one observation that is
**not** a gap: the boxed action now out-weighs the bare-text `Open board →` above it, which is DG-3's `@uat`
question, not an A2 miss. **A6 conforms in letter, and DG-5 is now witnessed in real pixels** — the node panel
shows `build-box-01` as hollow-dot / `last seen 30m ago` while the picker offers it with **no cue at all**.
**A7 SPLIT** — the states conform (measured decay **4968 ms**), the geometry fails, and the hung leg was
unspecified. **A10 SPLIT** — height conforms (38px in every state; sibling card heights match), rhythm does not.

**Gaps.**
- **GAP-S2-1 (→ DG-13) · regions 6+5 · A10 "or its rhythm" + A8** — the picker collapses to a bare chevron in
  the refused state and the row reflows on every label swap; region 5 never names the target in full. Decided in
  Amendment (b).
- **GAP-S2-2 (→ DG-14) · region 6 · no States row** — a hung POST wedges `Assigning…` forever. Decided in
  Amendment (b).
- **GAP-S2-3 · a BUILD DEFECT, not a rule change** — one frame shows the frozen picker reading
  `zzz-second-node` while the chip reads `→ aaa-firs…`: one card, two targets, one dispatch. The `sent` row's
  whole warrant is "selection frozen **on the chosen node** … the target is named for free." **This is the
  developer's to fix; the rule must NOT be amended to match the pixels.**

**NOT-ASSESSED — do not infer a verdict for any of these.** The `<select>` in its **OPEN** state (a native
dropdown is OS chrome, outside the page compositor, so headless Chromium cannot capture it — the option set was
verified textually instead: `["build-box-01","umamis-mac-mini","umamis-msi"]` in node-id order, which is what A3
is judged on); **390 / 768** (§Surface 2's own recorded reason); the **`Assigning…` → `Sent` transition** (two
stills cannot witness the no-flicker clause); the m35 chip's **dot hollow-vs-filled** (below crop resolution —
A8's dot is unjudged, owed a zoom crop); **region 7** beneath the row (no resolvable session in these fixtures);
the **full-board disclosure** question (two cards is not a board); and the **`@manual` soak**.

**What's owed at `aof:verify`:**
- A **render of the work-item card carrying the affordance**, from the **built `ui/dist`** served against a
  **fixture `/api/mesh/status`** with (a) an **empty roster** (A4), (b) a **one-node** roster (A5), (c) a
  **multi-node live+stale** roster (A6), and (d) an item with a **real minted `assigned` record** so region
  5's chip renders (A8) — screenshotted via **headless Chromium** (the cached `ms-playwright` build driven
  directly; `npx playwright` is policy-blocked — see work memory "design render via headless Chromium"). The
  **orchestration renders and hands the screenshots; the designer judges.** Running the browser is
  QA/orchestration's job, **not** the designer's.
- Judge **at 1280 only.** Carried from §Surface 1's NOT-ASSESSED note: **390 / 768 are effectively
  unrenderable** for this page — at 390px the milestone list makes the page ~20,000px tall, beyond Chrome's
  max canvas — so **1280 is the practical breakpoint**, and every Surface-2 verdict covers 1280 alone until a
  narrow-viewport strategy exists.
- The **`@manual` outsider soak** (story-04 task 04) — a person assigns a REAL item to a REAL node in the
  REAL UI and confirms the chip — remains the human gate, closed at `aof:verify 38`.

> **Note 2026-07-23 (a).** The renders handed for §Surface 3 DO show the affordance row (one-node roster,
> `umamis-msi` preselected, `Assign →` at rest) on all three milestone cards, but they were produced to
> exercise the TERMINAL states, not the affordance's own state axis (no empty roster, no multi-node roster,
> no in-flight/refused state, no freshly-minted `assigned` chip). §Surface 2's verdict therefore **stays
> INCONCLUSIVE**: a partial incidental frame is not the render this checklist owes. One observation is
> recorded from those pixels as **DG-11** (the footer attention cluster truncates to `a…`).
>
> **Note 2026-07-23 (b) — THE PRE-FIX PIXELS OF `Assign →` ARE VOID. See DG-12.** Until 2026-07-23 an
> unlayered `button,input,select,textarea{font:inherit}` in `ui/src/index.css` outranked every Tailwind

> larger-but-lighter. Any impression of the affordance formed from a pre-fix frame — including the

## Surface 3 — the fleet terminal-VIEW mirror (NEW — story 06, 2026-07-19)

**This is the milestone's SECOND fleet-face carve-out — a READ one, not a mutation — and the conformance
baseline for story 06's on-screen render.** Authored 2026-07-19; it did not exist before this pass.
`aof:verify 38` judges the terminal-view **region-by-region against V1–V12 and the terminal-view States
table** below. **There is no mock** (binding-checklist-only, as §Surface 1/§Surface 2).

> ~~"**NO browser surface was built this pass.** Story 06's three `@executable` tasks (00–02) delivered the
> BACKEND only … **Confirmed at source:** grep `terminal-view` across `ui/` = **0 matches** … There is
> **no `ui/` terminal-view component**. The on-screen rendering is part of the deferred `@manual` soak
> (task 03). Absent a built component AND a handed render, the verdict is **INCONCLUSIVE**."~~ —

> discipline working.** The remedy it named has been carried out.

**BUILT 2026-07-23 (story 06 / task 04, BLOCKER F-38.06c).** The on-screen view now exists:
- `ui/src/fleet/terminal-view/FleetTerminalView.tsx` — the thin React consumer (xterm + FitAddon, the
  board dock's wiring with the INPUT half deliberately not ported; `disableStdin: true`).
- `ui/src/fleet/terminal-view/stream.mjs` — framework-free (nodeId, sessionId) resolution + the V1 header
  model (`terminalStreamHeader`, `readOnlyLabel`).
- `ui/src/fleet/terminal-view/view-state.mjs` — the framework-free state ramp
  (`waiting for output` / `streaming` / `stream ended` / `disconnected` / `no live output`), whose
  terminal-assignment copy derives from `assignmentChip(row)` (§Correction 3).
- Mounted from `ui/src/fleet/Fleet.tsx` on the **work-item (milestone) card**, as a sibling **below** the
  §Surface 2 assign affordance row (see §Surface 2's 2026-07-23 addendum).

**Governs:** the fleet view at `?mode=fleet` — the **read-only terminal-VIEW** that mirrors a worker's live
PTY byte stream, fed by the `/ws/terminal-view` route (`src/mesh-ui-serve.mjs`) over the in-memory ephemeral
mirror (`src/mesh-terminal-mirror.mjs`). **This is NOT §Surface 1's node card and NOT §Surface 2's work-item
card** — it is a NEW live-stream view, discovered by resolving an assignment's (nodeId, sessionId) via the
ADR-013 `session_id` (opening an assignment's card resolves its stream and subscribes).

**The binding rail this carves out (a READ carve-out, NOT a mutation):** m25 / §Surface-1 pinned a read-only
rail; §Surface 2 (story 04) carved out ONE mutation (assign). Story 06 carves out a NEW READ surface — the
fleet face, which previously served NO `/ws/terminal` and destroyed every upgrade (ADR-006), now serves a
server→browser terminal-VIEW. **This does NOT add a second mutation.** The terminal-view is read-only IN
FACT (ADR-014 invariant 1 / SECURITY T14): server→browser only, no mesh→PTY input path. Read-WRITE control
(keystrokes from the fleet) is a Phase-2 concern, structurally absent. **The design consequence: the view
must READ as view-only** — no input box, no send control, no type-into cursor — so the operator is never
misled into believing a keystroke reaches the worker.

### The terminal-view's anatomy — regions, in order (what a reviewer ticks against)

**Region 0 — placement + disclosure.** The view is a **per-card panel** on the work-item card, a sibling
BELOW the §Surface 2 affordance row, **collapsed by default** behind a `Watch terminal →` toggle. Regions 1
and 2 render **always** (collapsed or open); region 3 renders only when opened. A card whose assignment
carries **no resolvable (nodeId, sessionId) tuple renders NO panel at all** — not an empty frame, not a
disabled toggle (ADR-014 invariant 4 / V1). Judged against **V12**.

1. **Stream-identity header** — WHICH stream this is: the `nodeId` + the resolved assignment/session (the ADR-013 `session_id`, surfaced as the human assignment/ref it belongs to where possible, not a raw id alone). The operator must never be in doubt whose terminal they are watching. Judged against **V1**.
2. **READ-ONLY posture indicator** — an explicit, quiet `read-only` / `view only` marker so the view-only posture is legible by LABEL, not merely by the absence of an input box. Judged against **V2/V6**. The **state chip** sits here too: the short state word, never the long reason (V11).
3. **The live terminal byte stream** — the worker's `/ws/terminal` PTY output rendered as terminal text, in the SAME terminal rendering idiom the board-side `TerminalDock` already uses (mono, xterm-style) — no fleet-local terminal chrome. Live-tail-forward from subscribe; the mirror is ephemeral, so there is no disk scrollback. Judged against **V3/V4/V7**. Its **non-live message bar** (waiting / ended / disconnected / no-live-output) is judged against **V11**.
4. **NO input region** — there is NO text input, NO send button, NO keystroke-capturing cursor affordance. The row a read-write terminal would spend on an input box is **absent, not disabled** (a greyed input would falsely promise "coming soon" and invite the mis-read that you could type). Judged against **V2/V5**.

### The binding rules (V1–V12)

| # | Binding rule | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **V1** | **The view always names its stream.** The header identifies the (nodeId, sessionId) being mirrored, resolved to the human assignment/ref where possible (ADR-013 `session_id`). A terminal with no visible owner is forbidden — the operator must know whose output this is at a glance. | ADR-013 |
| **V2** | **Read-only IN FACT and IN LOOK — no input affordance exists.** No text input, no send/submit control, no type-into cursor. The absence is structural (mirrors ADR-014 invariant 1: no mesh→PTY input path) and must be VISIBLE as read-only — the surface reads as a monitor, never as an attachable shell. | **load-bearing** · T14 |
| **V3** | **Reuse the existing terminal rendering — invent no fleet-local terminal vocabulary.** The bytes render in the board `TerminalDock`'s terminal idiom (mono, xterm-style), not a new fleet-specific terminal chrome, colour, or frame. | mirrors S5 |
| **V4** | **Live-tail-forward off an EPHEMERAL mirror — no fabricated backlog.** The mirror is in-memory and never a system of record (ADR-014); the view shows the live tail from the moment it subscribes. It must NOT fabricate scrollback, replay from disk, or imply durable history — kill the mirror and the view is empty, not wrong. | ADR-014 |
| **V5** | **A keystroke does NOT reach the worker — proven, not asserted.** The read-only-in-fact expectation: typing while the view is focused produces NO terminal-input frame toward the worker PTY. This is the load-bearing invariant the `@manual` soak proves LIVE (task 03) — the view may not even accept focus-to-type; if it does, the keystroke is inert. | T14 · ADR-014 inv.1 |
| **V6** | **Colour AND label travel together (read-only posture).** The read-only state is signalled by an explicit label (V2's marker), never by colour/icon alone — the same m25 rail §Surface 1 S4 pins. | m25 rail |
| **V7** | **Empty / rebuild-starts-empty is an HONEST state, not a spinner-forever nor an error.** Before any byte arrives — a fresh subscribe, or the mirror rebuilt empty — the view shows an honest waiting/empty state (e.g. `waiting for output` / `no live output yet`), NOT an infinite spinner, NOT a fabricated line, NOT a red error. An empty mirror is the NORMAL cold-start, not a failure. | |
| **V8** | **Multiplex is keyed by (nodeId, sessionId); streams NEVER cross-wire.** Multiple workers/sessions are multiplexed by (nodeId, sessionId) — the view for one stream renders ONLY that stream's bytes; a frame with no resolvable (nodeId, sessionId) is dropped, never bled into an unrelated view (ADR-014 invariant 4). Opening a second assignment's terminal shows a SEPARATE stream, correctly labelled (V1). | ADR-014 inv.4 |
| **V9** | **Stream-ended is legible — no frozen pretend-live.** When the session ends or the stream drops, the view says so (e.g. `stream ended` / `disconnected`) rather than freezing on the last frame as if still live. A dead stream must not masquerade as a live one — the same anti-ghost discipline §Surface 1 S8 pins for expired sessions. | mirrors S8 |
| **V10** | **`waiting` may only be said while output is still POSSIBLE — and the REASON is spoken in the m35 ramp's own words.** A stream whose assignment has reached a terminal state and has produced no bytes must never read `waiting for output`. **Terminal-ness AND the wording both come from `assignmentChip(row)` (`ui/src/fleet/assignments.mjs`) — never from the raw `state` string and never from a hand-maintained list:** chip label `done` or `failed` ⇒ terminal ⇒ the view reads **`no live output — assignment <chip.label>`**, plus the chip's own trailing ` · <note>` when it carries one (`· reclaimed`). Every other label — including the forward-compat `unknown` — is NOT terminal and keeps `waiting for output` (we may not assert output is impossible for a state we do not recognise). **Resolution stays tuple-only** (never state-filtered — a filter would hide a real stream, the A3/"membership not liveness" discipline); it is the LABEL that must tell the truth, not the routing. ~~"a TERMINAL state (`done` / `failed` / `reclaimed`)"~~ — **corrected 2026-07-23, §Correction 3: the enumeration leaked `withdrawn` and `stale`. WITNESSED render F.** | **NEW 2026-07-23** · mirrors S8 · A8 |
| **V11** | **A non-live message must never overprint the frame it describes — and never costs the CARD height.** The message is chrome, not output: the byte pane is `flex-1` in a column and the message is a **flow sibling bar BELOW it** (`border-t border-[#1e2a44]`, `bg-[#0f1629]`), so xterm refits into the smaller box and no glyph is ever covered. **The panel's TOTAL height is unchanged** — the bar is paid for out of the byte pane, never by growing the card (a card that grew when a stream ended would reflow every sibling in its stretched grid row, DG-9). The dead frame may be dimmed (`opacity-60`), but the LABEL always carries the meaning (V6 — dimming never travels alone). **The header state chip carries the STATE in the ramp's short vocabulary** (`waiting for output` · `streaming` · `stream ended` · `disconnected` · `no live output`); **the BAR carries the reason** (`no live output — assignment failed · reclaimed`). A chip that grows into a full sentence wraps the header and pushes the toggle out of its hierarchy (V12). Top-left placement is kept **only** for the empty-pane states (`waiting`, and `no live output` when zero bytes arrived), where nothing can be overprinted. | **NEW 2026-07-23** · mirrors V6/V9 |
| **V12** | **Disclosure: per-card, collapsed by default, identity ALWAYS on.** One card = one stream. The panel is collapsed behind a `Watch terminal →` toggle (the board's `→` action idiom); regions 1–2 (identity + `read-only`) render **even when collapsed**, so the posture is legible BEFORE the operator opens anything and no socket is opened until they do. **The toggle is the QUIETEST element in the header** — the reading order is identity > `read-only` marker > state > toggle; a toggle that outweighs the stream's own name inverts a monitor into a control. A card with no resolvable tuple renders **no panel at all**. | **NEW 2026-07-23** · resolves DG-8/DG-7 |

RATIONALE for **V2/V5** (the rules the review exists to enforce): a worker terminal that LOOKS interactive
but silently swallows keystrokes is a worse lie than no terminal — the operator would believe they answered
a `needs-input` prompt when nothing reached the worker. Read-write is Phase-2; until then the honest surface
is a MONITOR that visibly cannot type, and the "does a keystroke reach the worker" question is un-fakeable,
so it is the soak's central assertion (task 03).

RATIONALE for **V3/V4**: the fleet already borrows the board's terminal rendering; a second terminal
vocabulary would be the fourth-ramp mistake §Surface 1 S5 exists to prevent. And the mirror is DERIVED
liveness, not data (ADR-014) — presenting it as durable scrollback would tell the operator the fleet
remembers what it explicitly does not.

RATIONALE for **V7/V9**: the mirror's ephemerality means empty-on-cold-start and empty-on-rebuild are the
DESIGNED normal, not errors; and a stream that ended must read as ended, mirroring the milestone's core
anti-lie discipline (never show a liveness the source no longer asserts, §Surface 1 S8).

RATIONALE for **V10**: `waiting for output` is a PROMISE. On a live assignment it is honest — bytes are
plausibly next. On a finished one it is the same species of lie as a stuck `working`: the surface asserts
an expectation the source can no longer meet, and the operator sits watching a window that will never move.
The fix is copy, not routing — **never filter the stream away** (that would hide a real captured session
and repeat DG-5's mistake of throwing information away at the moment of choosing). And the copy is
**borrowed, not minted**: the m35 chip ramp already decides that `withdrawn` reads `failed` and that
`reclaimed`/`stale` read `failed · reclaimed`. A terminal-view that spelled those states its own way would
be a second assignment vocabulary on one card — A8's rule, at a new address (§Correction 3).

RATIONALE for **V11**: the ended message and the last frame occupy the same pixels, so the reader loses
both — the state message AND the final output line, which is precisely the line they came to read. Chrome
that destroys the content it annotates is worse than no chrome. Two further constraints make the flow-bar
the right answer rather than an overlay: an absolute overlay still covers the newest line (measured), and
a bar that ADDED height would make every sibling card in the stretched row jump at the moment a stream
ends. Paying for the bar out of the byte pane costs ~29px of tail **only in the dead states**, where no
further bytes are coming and the operator's need has shifted from watching to reading the last lines.

RATIONALE for **V12**: a permanently-open 192px black viewport on every assigned card would convert the
fleet from a monitor you scan into a wall of terminals you cannot scan (the DG-3 concern, one order of
magnitude louder), and would open N sockets on page load for streams nobody is watching. Collapsed-by-
default with the identity + `read-only` label always visible gives the operator the FACT (this card has a
watchable, read-only stream, and whose it is) at monitor cost, and the BYTES only on request. The
multi-pane "wall" (RESEARCH §4.3/§4.5) remains future work, deliberately.

### States (the terminal-view's own state axis — the story-06 state set)

| State | Chip (header) | Bar (below the bytes) | When |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **no stream** | *(no panel at all — no header, no toggle, no empty frame)* | — | the assignment carries no `sessionId` (or no `targetNodeId`): a half-tuple resolves to nothing (ADR-014 inv.4) |
| **collapsed (at rest)** | *(no state chip)* — identity + `read-only` + `Watch terminal →` only; **no socket open** | — | the default for every resolvable stream |
| **empty / cold-start** | `waiting for output` | *(top-left placement, empty pane)* | subscribed, no byte received yet; OR the mirror was rebuilt (starts empty) |
| **streaming (live)** | `streaming` (pulsing dot) | — (full-height byte pane) | frames flowing for this (nodeId, sessionId) |
| **multiplexed** | each open stream is its OWN correctly-labelled view; no cross-wiring | | ≥2 (nodeId, sessionId) streams open |
| **ended / disconnected** | `stream ended` / `disconnected` | `stream ended` / `disconnected`, frame dimmed | session ended or the stream dropped |
| **terminal-state assignment, no bytes** | `no live output` | `no live output — assignment <m35 chip label>` (+ `· reclaimed`) | the stream resolves but its assignment is terminal per `assignmentChip` (V10). **Witnessed render F** |
| **unresolvable** | the view is not shown / the frame is dropped — never bled into another card | | a frame with no resolvable (nodeId, sessionId) (ADR-014 inv.4) |

### Design ramp for the terminal-view

- **Terminal bytes = the board `TerminalDock` rendering idiom** (mono, xterm-style) — reused, not reinvented (V3).
- **Read-only posture = an explicit quiet marker + the ABSENCE of any input affordance** — legible by label, not colour alone (V2/V6).
- **Empty / ended = honest text states**, never a spinner-forever or a red error for the NORMAL cold-start/ended cases (V7/V9), never overprinting the bytes, and never growing the card (V11). A genuine transport failure is the existing fleet read-failure token (`destructive`), reused — no terminal-local error primitive.
- **Terminal-assignment wording = the m35 assignment ramp's own labels** (V10) — borrowed, never minted.
- **No new fleet-local terminal chrome, colour, badge, or "streaming" accent.** The review flags any
  terminal-view-specific primitive as a gap (mirrors S5/A9).

### RATIONALE

- **Why a read-only MONITOR that visibly cannot type (not a disabled interactive shell):** read-write is
  Phase-2 (ADR-014). A terminal that looks attachable but is inert teaches the operator to distrust the
  surface — worse than showing nothing. The honest move is a view that IS a monitor and SAYS so.
- **Why reuse the board terminal idiom (V3):** the fleet already renders a terminal (board-side); a second
  terminal look would be a fourth vocabulary. One terminal idiom, spoken on two surfaces.
- **Why empty is normal, not an error (V7):** the mirror is ephemeral and never a system of record — a
  cold or rebuilt mirror is EXPECTED to be empty; painting that as a failure would lie about the design.

### Review status — Surface 3 — **CONFORMS on all witnessed states; NOT-ASSESSED residue owed** (2026-07-23; three render passes)

**The verdict moved INCONCLUSIVE (2026-07-19) → GAPS (first two passes) → CONFORMS-on-witnessed (this pass).
All three gaps — GAP-1, GAP-2, GAP-3 — are CLOSED against real pixels.** What remains is NOT a divergence: it
is a set of states never put in frame (the collapsed default, `disconnected`, mirror-rebuilt-empty, V8 at
byte level) plus the inherently non-pixel V5 — recorded **NOT ASSESSED** per §Default-10, never assumed. A
single fresh frame of the collapsed default is the one thing between this and an unqualified whole-surface
CONFORMS.

> **The 2026-07-19 INCONCLUSIVE, retained:** *no browser surface was built this pass, no mock pre-existed,
> and no render was handed.* `grep terminal-view` across `ui/` returned 0 matches. The honest verdict was
> INCONCLUSIVE naming the missing input — **not** a CONFORMS/GAPS inferred from the relay/mirror/route code.
> **The remedy it demanded (build the view, render it, judge the pixels) has been carried out**, which is
> the only reason a verdict is possible today.

**Judged from FIVE real 1280px renders** of the **built `ui/dist`** fleet at `?mode=fleet&scope=global`,
served against a fixture `/api/mesh/status` and a fixture `/ws/terminal-view`, driven in headless Chromium
over CDP — the terminals were opened by a real click and real bytes really streamed. The orchestration
rendered; the designer judged. Renders:

- **A — empty / cold-start** (socket open, zero bytes sent).
- **B — streaming live AND multiplexed** (milestone 38 → `umamis-mac-mini`, milestone 39 → `umamis-thinkpad`, both open).
- **D — stream ended** (server closed the socket cleanly). *First pass.*
- **E — stream ended, after the GAP-1 / GAP-2 fixes.** *Second pass, same day.*
- **F — two TERMINAL-STATE cards** (`done`; `stale`+`reclaimedAt`), each with a captured session and zero bytes. *Third pass — V10.*

In A/B/D/E the THIRD card (milestone 40) holds an assignment with **no `sessionId`** (no panel). In F,
cards 38 and 39 carry captured sessions on TERMINAL assignments; card 40 stays `assigned`, no panel.

#### Region ledger

| Region | Verdict | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **0 · placement + disclosure** | **CONFORMS (open half) · NOT ASSESSED (collapsed half)** | All renders: the panel is a sibling below the assign row, inside the card's content box, on the card's own `mt-3` rhythm. Cards with no `sessionId` render **no panel at all** — no header, no toggle, no empty frame. The **collapsed at-rest** presentation — the DEFAULT every operator sees — is in **none** of the five captures (all show `Hide terminal`). See NOT ASSESSED. |
| **1 · stream-identity header** | **CONFORMS** | A/B/D/E/F: `38 → umamis-mac-mini · session 5f3c1e00-ab90-4d21-9f7a…` and `39 → umamis-thinkpad · session 7e21aa10-cd34-4a55-8b0c…`. Human ref + node + session, never a raw id alone. |
| **2 · read-only posture marker + state chip** | **CONFORMS** *(GAP-2 closed at render E)* | `READ-ONLY` pill in neutral zinc in **every** state, beside a dot+label state chip. Render F: the chip reads the short `● no live output` on both terminal-state cards, does not wrap, and the toggle stays on-row — the hierarchy holds. |
| **3 · live byte stream + message bar** | **CONFORMS** *(GAP-1 closed at render E; GAP-3 witnessed at render F)* | A: empty. B: live tail in the dock idiom. E: `stream ended` on a flow bar below a refitted pane, dead frame dimmed, last line legible. F: `no live output — assignment done` / `no live output — assignment failed · reclaimed`, top-left over an empty pane (nothing to overprint). |
| **4 · NO input region** | **CONFORMS — witnessed ABSENT** | All renders: below the byte area the panel simply ends. No input box, no send control, **no disabled input**, no prompt row, no caret in the empty viewport. Absent, not disabled — exactly V2's "structural absence." |

#### Rule ledger (V1–V12)

| Rule | Ruling | What I saw |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **V1** | **CONFORMS** | Every open terminal names its stream with the human ref + node + session. The negative half is witnessed too: a card with no `sessionId` renders **no terminal at all** — never a guessed session, never an anonymous terminal. |
| **V2** | **CONFORMS** | Explicit `READ-ONLY` label in all states; no input affordance of any kind, disabled or otherwise. |
| **V3** | **CONFORMS** | The chrome is the board `TerminalDock`'s, reused: same `▣ TERMINAL` lockup, same `#0f1629` / `#1e2a44` / `#0b0f14` values, same dot+label state ramp. The message bar uses those same two tokens — **no new primitive minted.** **The wide, letter-spaced glyphs are NOT scored** — see NOT ASSESSED / ARTIFACT. |
| **V4** | **CONFORMS** | Render A is the proof: a subscribed socket with zero bytes shows an **empty** viewport — no fabricated backlog. Render F's terminal-state cards likewise show zero fabricated scrollback behind the `no live output` message. |
| **V5** | **NOT ASSESSABLE FROM A RENDER (by nature)** | "Does a keystroke reach the worker" is not a pixel fact. Closed by the task-03 `@manual` soak + the structural `acd-fleet-terminal-mirror-read-only` fitness. |
| **V6** | **CONFORMS** | Posture by LABEL, not colour; every state ships dot **and** text. Render E's dimmed dead frame is an *additional* cue behind a label that still carries the meaning — dimming does not travel alone. |
| **V7** | **CONFORMS** | Render A: `waiting for output`, muted, **static** dot. No spinner, no motion, no red, no fabricated line. Motion is reserved for `streaming` (render B: pulsing `primary` dot). |
| **V8** | **SPLIT — header-level CONFORMS · byte-level NOT ASSESSABLE FROM THESE RENDERS** | Render B shows two views open at once, each headed with its OWN tuple, plus a third card with no tuple and no panel. But **both viewports show byte-identical text** (the fixture's node-naming lines had scrolled out of the pane). **EVIDENCE-GAP-1**, a harness gap, still open. |
| **V9** | **CONFORMS — GAP-1 CLOSED at render E** | The header chip AND the bar both read `stream ended`, the frozen frame is dimmed, and the last output line survives. A dead stream cannot be mistaken for a live one, and reading it costs nothing. |
| **V10** | **CONFORMS — WITNESSED render F, and CORRECTED §Correction 3** | Card 38 (`done`) → header `● no live output`, bar `no live output — assignment done`. Card 39 (`stale`+`reclaimedAt`, chip degrades to `! failed`, node summary `1 failed`) → header `● no live output`, bar `no live output — assignment failed · reclaimed`. **Both bars use the SAME words the same card's assignment chip and node summary use** — the derivation from `assignmentChip(row)` is witnessed end-to-end, not asserted. The leak is closed: `stale`/`withdrawn` no longer sit on `waiting for output`. |
| **V11** | **CONFORMS** | Render E witnesses the ended-state bar + constant-total-height; render F witnesses the chip/bar SPLIT (chip = short state `no live output`, bar = full reason). The chip stays in-family and never wraps the header. |
| **V12** | **CONFORMS in "identity always on" + hierarchy · NOT ASSESSED in its collapsed half** | GAP-2 closed at render E; the toggle is the lightest header element (measured 11/400, class `text-[11px] text-zinc-400`, no `font-semibold`). The collapsed frame was never captured. |

#### The gaps — ALL CLOSED

**GAP-1 · region 3 · the non-live message overprinted the frozen frame — CLOSED 2026-07-23 (render E).**
- **Was:** render D painted `stream ended` unbacked over `  Reading STORY.md + task features..`; neither
  was readable (inherited from `TerminalDock`'s ERROR overlay, which in the dock only ever fires over an
  effectively empty pane).
- **Now:** the byte pane is `flex-1` in a `flex flex-col` and the message is a **flow sibling bar** below it
  (`border-t border-[#1e2a44] bg-[#0f1629]`), so xterm **refits** into the smaller box. Render E: the last
  line (`18 modules)`) is fully legible and `stream ended` sits below it in the dock's own tokens; the dead
  frame is dimmed to `opacity-60`.
- **The 163px bytes + 29px bar trade is RATIFIED**, and the reason is bound into V11: **192 = 163 + 29 keeps
  the panel's TOTAL height constant**, so a stream ending causes **no reflow** of the card or its stretched
  grid-row siblings. The cost is paid only in the dead states, exactly when no more bytes are coming and the
  operator's need has shifted from watching to reading the tail. The developer **measured** that the
  absolute-overlay option still covered the newest line (last row y 162–184 under a 29px bar) and took
  V11's other named treatment rather than papering over it — the correct response to a two-treatment rule.
- **Accepted, not a gap:** `stream ended` appears twice (header chip + bar). The two serve different reading
  moments, and with V10 in place the two strings deliberately diverge (chip `no live output`, bar
  `no live output — assignment failed`).

**GAP-2 · region 2 · the toggle was the loudest thing in a read-only monitor's header — CLOSED
2026-07-23 (render E); root cause found, not papered over; the residual is now also clean.**
- **Root cause:** an unlayered `button,input,select,textarea{font:inherit}` in `ui/src/index.css` outranked
  every Tailwind utility layer — **every `<button>` in the app silently ignored its `text-*`/`font-*`
  classes**. The toggle computed **16px/400**. Tailwind's preflight already ships the identical rule inside
  `@layer base`, so the duplicate was deleted (not patched around). This is the app-wide **DG-12**.
- **Now:** measured header `lockup 11/600 | identity 11/400 | read-only 10/600 | state 11/400 |
  toggle 11/400` — the toggle is the lightest element, the reading order V12 asks for, confirmed in render E.
- **The residual I flagged is CLOSED (coordinator confirmed at source 2026-07-23):** the built component's
  toggle class is `text-[11px] text-zinc-400` with **no** `font-semibold` — the `font-semibold removed`
  text is prose in a code comment, not in the class string. Class and computed value agree at 11/400. The
  hierarchy is right by construction, not by accident. No action.

**GAP-3 · region 3 copy · `waiting for output` on a stream that can never produce output — CLOSED
2026-07-23 (render F), via §Correction 3.**
- Implemented at the presentation layer only; routing stays tuple-only. **V10 as first written enumerated
  three terminal states and leaked `withdrawn` and `stale`** — the enumeration was replaced by a derivation
  from `assignmentChip(row)` (§Correction 3), the `TERMINAL_ASSIGNMENT_STATES` set deleted, `withdrawn` and
  `stale` explicitly guarded (20 assertions green, per the developer). Render F witnesses both terminal-state
  cards reading `no live output — assignment …` in the m35 ramp's own words. Closed.

**EVIDENCE-GAP-1 · V8 byte-level · the harness cannot prove no-cross-wiring. STILL OPEN (harness, not build).**
- Prefix **every** emitted line with the node short name (e.g. `[mac-mini] … worker heartbeat`), or capture
  within the first frames, then re-hand render B. Until then V8's byte-level half stays NOT ASSESSED — the
  structural tuple-keying evidence in `stream.mjs` is a CODE fact, and this review does not accept code in
  place of pixels.

#### NOT ASSESSED — do not infer (the honest residue)

- **The collapsed at-rest presentation** — the state EVERY operator sees by default, and it is in none of
  the five captures (all were driven open). A render of a resolvable card **collapsed** is owed: it is the
  only way to judge V12's own default, the header's wrap behaviour without the state chip, and whether a
  dark strip on every assigned card is quiet enough for a monitor. **This is the one frame between the
  surface and an unqualified CONFORMS.**
- **V8 at byte level** — see EVIDENCE-GAP-1.
- **V5 (a keystroke cannot reach the worker)** — not a pixel question; owed by the task-03 `@manual` soak.
- **The `disconnected` (transport-failure) state** — never rendered. Its `destructive` token, and whether a
  genuine failure reads distinctly from a clean `stream ended`, are unjudged.
- **The mirror-rebuilt-empty half of V7** — render A proves cold-start-empty; a rebuilt-mid-stream mirror
  was not staged.
- **THE GLYPH WIDTH IS A PROBABLE ARTIFACT, NOT A DESIGN FACT.** The terminal text renders wide and
  letter-spaced in all captures with bytes (B/D/E). Positive evidence it is headless font substitution: the
  component requests the **same** stack the board dock requests
  (`var(--font-mono, ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, monospace)`), the headless container has none of
  those, and in the *same* capture the DOM's own mono text (`C:/Source/umami/aof`, `fabric addr:`, the node
  ids) renders at normal width — the distortion appears only inside xterm's measured character cells.
  **This is NOT scored against V3.** (Render F's message text is DOM, not xterm, and renders at normal
  width — corroborating the diagnosis.)
- **390 / 768 breakpoints** — carried forward from §Surface 1/2: unrenderable for this page. **This verdict
  covers 1280 alone.**

#### What's owed at `aof:verify`

- **A re-render** covering: (a) the **collapsed** default (V12) — the last unwitnessed state of this
  surface; (b) render B re-shot with per-line node naming (EVIDENCE-GAP-1); (c) ideally the `disconnected`
  state.
- The **`@manual` outsider soak** (task 03) — a REAL worker's live terminal in the REAL fleet view, routed
  to the correct node/session; **a keystroke does NOT reach the worker** (V5); live multiplex across two
  workers (V8); no on-screen secret (T14). Still the un-fakeable human gate.

## Design-conformance review — status (2026-07-12, second pass)

Judged from **three live, producer-fed 1280px renders** of **Surface 1a** (`GlobalNodePanel`,
`?mode=fleet&scope=global`) — real Claude Code hook, real `aof session` CLI, a real `aof work run-start`
run record, real presence daemon, real `/api/mesh/status`. **No fixtures.** Frames judged as a set
(several states are mutually exclusive on one node and cannot share a frame).

### States-table ledger

| State | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **idle** | **WITNESSED — CONFORMS** | all frames; `peer-git`, `umamis-mac-mini` muted `idle` |
| **running** | **WITNESSED — CONFORMS** | FRAME A — `running 1 run`, `primary`, correctly pluralised |
| **working-session** | **WITNESSED — CONFORMS** | FRAME A — `working · pilot-app-portal (session)` |
| **two-repos** | **WITNESSED — CONFORMS** | FRAME B — `working · pilot-app-portal, aof (session)`: one prefix, comma-join, `(session)` once, no truncation at 1280 |
| **run + cross-workspace session** | **WITNESSED — CONFORMS** | FRAME A — two `primary` lines, run first; the `aof` session subsumed by its run while `pilot-app-portal`'s survives |
| **stale-expired** | **WITNESSED — CONFORMS** | FRAME C — `idle`, muted, **while the hard-killed session record is still physically on disk**. No ghost. The strongest frame of the three |

**All 5 (now 6) States rows are WITNESSED.** Previously 2 of 5.

### Rule ledger

- **S3 (peer emphasis) — WITNESSED, CONFORMS.** FRAME A puts `running 1 run` and
  `working · pilot-app-portal (session)` in the **same card, same slot, one image**, in **identical weight
  and identical primary token**. This was the claim I refused to infer; it is now proven.
- **S2, S4, S5, S6, S8 — CONFORMS** across all three frames. **S5 in particular: no session-specific
  chip, badge, dot, icon, accent or background in any state, including the two-line stack.**
- **S1, S7, S9 — the BUILD conforms; the CHECKLIST was wrong and has been corrected** (§Correction 2).
- **S10 — VERIFIED BY CONTRACT TEST, NOT BY SCREENSHOT.** `test/arch/acd-captured-producer-fixture.test.mjs`
  asserts the JS and Rust projections render the same line for the same captured payload, and is green.
  **This satisfies the designer** — a byte-identity claim is a test's job; a screenshot could only ever
  show it *looked* the same. The desktop pixel is **not** owed for S10.

### NOT ASSESSED — do not infer

- **390 / 768 breakpoints** — still unrenderable (at 390px the page is ~20,000px tall; the NODES region
  falls beyond Chrome's max canvas). **Every verdict here covers 1280 only.**
- **The desktop row's LOOK** (Surface 1b) — no render captured. S10 (the *string*) is closed by contract
  test; the desktop's *tokens, layout and two-line stack* are **unjudged**.
- **`running N runs` with N ≥ 2 across two real workspaces** — not witnessed (the F11 bug used to fake it).
- **Repo ORDER stability** on the session line — see DG-2. One frame cannot prove an order is deterministic.

### Debt note — 2026-07-23 — these frames were judged under a global button-type bug (DG-12)

**The S1–S11 verdicts above STAND.** The current-work region is plain `text-[13px]` spans, not a
`<button>`, so the unlayered `font:inherit` rule that broke every button in the app (DG-12) could not have
touched the pixels those rulings rest on — including S3's peer-emphasis claim, whose two labels are both
spans in one card.

**What IS owed is a CONTEXT re-look, not a re-judgement.** On those frames every button on the page —
the card's own `Open board →` wrapper, the scope toggle, `legend` — rendered at **16px/400** instead of its
specified type. Design conformance for a region is partly a claim about its **relative prominence among its
neighbours**, and the neighbours have now changed weight. **One fresh 1280 frame of `GlobalNodePanel` is
owed at `aof:verify`**, to confirm the current-work region still reads as the region these verdicts
describe — e.g. that it has not been quietly out-shouted by a now-correctly-semibold `Open board →`. Cheap,
and it closes the honest doubt rather than carrying it silently.

---

## Deferred design-gap findings (recorded so they are not lost)

### DG-1 — one presence ramp, two vocabularies (pre-existing; deferred, NOT m38's to fix)

- **Observed:** the same node-liveness fact is spoken in **two vocabularies**. `GlobalNodePanel` renders
  `last seen 8d ago` / `never seen`; the m25-designed `PresenceLabel` ramp renders `♥ Ns` / `stale · Nm` /
  `no presence`. Likewise the capability footer reads `claude, codex` / `no capabilities` on one card and
  `runtimes · N skills` / `not enrolled · no skills` on the other.
- **The correct answer (designer owns it):** **one presence ramp, one vocabulary — the richer
  `♥ Ns` / `stale · Nm` / `no presence`** — on every surface, web and desktop. One capability-footer
  phrasing everywhere.
- **Resolution:** a DESIGN.md rule in the milestone that adopts it, **plus a `@uat` visual-review
  scenario**. Not a code patch alone.

### DG-2 — the session line's repo order is unbound (NEW, m38-adjacent, small)

- **Observed:** FRAME B renders `working · pilot-app-portal, aof (session)`. DESIGN never bound an order,
  and a single frame cannot prove the order is stable. If the projection emits map/insertion order, the
  line will silently reshuffle between polls (`aof, pilot-app-portal` ↔ `pilot-app-portal, aof`).
- **Why it matters:** a line that reorders under the reader's eyes is visual noise, and it makes the S10
  contract test and any future snapshot flaky for a reason that has nothing to do with the fact being told.
- **The correct answer (designer owns it, now bound as S6):** **deterministic alphabetical order by repo
  short name**, in **both** projections.
- **Action:** developer confirms `fleetCurrentWorkLines()` and Rust `current_work()` sort the repo list;
  add the sort if absent. Small; does not block the visual verdict.

### DG-3 — the affordance sits on EVERY milestone card, always-visible (NEW, m38 / story-04)

- **Observed (structural, from the checklist-vs-intent — NOT a render verdict):** `AssignAffordance` mounts
  unconditionally on **every** milestone card (`Fleet.tsx` renders it as a sibling on each card), so a
  picker + action row is permanently spent on every card whether or not the operator ever assigns from it.
  On a dense board this puts a control on a surface designed to be scanned (the read-only-monitor rail, A2).
- **Why it matters:** the read-only rail's whole value is that the fleet reads as a monitor at a glance; a
  permanent control on every card erodes that and adds a mis-click target to a scanning surface.
- **The correct answer (designer owns it):** decide between **always-visible-but-quiet** (A2 as written — acceptable
  if it stays subordinate) and **progressive disclosure** (reveal the affordance on card hover, reusing the
  card's existing `group-hover` idiom, so at rest the board stays a pure monitor). **A2 codifies the
  quiet-at-rest floor; the disclosure model is the open question.**
- **Resolution:** a DESIGN.md rule that picks the disclosure model, **plus a `@uat` visual-review scenario**
  (a person judges a full board of cards, not one card). Not a code patch alone. **Deferred — decided at
  the render, against A2.** *(2026-07-23: the terminal-view chose progressive disclosure for its own,
  heavier panel — V12. That is a precedent for this decision, not a decision of it. Note also that the
  affordance's true weight has only been visible since the DG-12 CSS fix.)*

### DG-4 — action and confirmation are spatially + temporally disjoint (NEW, m38 / story-04) — **DECIDED 2026-07-24 (F22, live soak)**

- **Observed (structural):** the operator ACTS in region 6 (the card foot) but the `assigned` confirmation
  appears in region 5 (the footer attention cluster, above) **after the 5s poll** (A7/A8 — no bespoke
  refresh). Between the click and the poll there is **no local confirmation at the point of action** beyond
  the transient `Assigning…`; the result then materialises elsewhere on the card, seconds later.
- **Why it matters:** a feedback loop where the effect is displaced from the action, and delayed, reads as
  "did that work?" — the operator may re-click or assume failure. Good affordance design keeps the
  acknowledgement near the action and prompt.
- **The correct answer (designer owns it):** either (a) an **in-row transient success acknowledgement** in
  region 6 (e.g. `Assigned →` settling to muted) that hands off to the region-5 chip on the next poll, or
  (b) an explicit design decision that the region-5 chip after ≤5s IS the acknowledgement and the transient
  `Assigning…` bridges the gap — **stated, not left implicit.** — **DECIDED 2026-07-24, at the live soak
  (F22), and the answer is (a) PLUS a repaired (b): a transient in-row `Sent` (muted, disabled, 5s, then
  gone) AND a success re-load so region 5's real chip arrives within a round trip instead of up to 5s.
  The word is `Sent`, not `Assigned` — the affordance reports the CALL, the chip reports the ASSIGNMENT.**
  Bound in **A7/A8** and the §Surface 2 States table; see **§Surface 2 · Amendment 2026-07-24**.
- **This was predicted structurally on 2026-07-18 and WITNESSED live on 2026-07-24:** the operator clicked,
  got `200 ok`, and the surface said nothing — they read the raw API response to learn it had worked.
- **Resolution:** a DESIGN.md rule + a `@uat` scenario (a person clicks assign and judges whether the result
  is legible without re-checking). **Rule DECIDED; the `@uat` scenario and the render remain owed.**

### DG-5 — the picker gives the operator no liveness cue (NEW, m38 / story-04, small)

- **Observed (structural):** the picker lists node ids as bare `<option>`s (A6) with **no liveness signal**,
  yet a **stale-but-known** node is a valid option (the verb keys on membership, not liveness). §Surface 1
  went to some length to make live-vs-stale legible in the presence vocabulary (`♥ Ns` / `stale · Nm`); the
  assign picker throws that away at the exact moment the operator is CHOOSING a target.
- **Why it matters:** the operator can dispatch to a node offline for days with zero visual warning, then
  discover it only via downstream behaviour. The picker should let them choose informed — while still
  ALLOWING the stale target (never a hidden filter, per A3).
- **The correct answer (designer owns it):** **annotate the option with liveness** in §Surface 1's presence
  vocabulary (e.g. `worker-b · stale`), never filter it out. Bound as the open half of **A6**; connects to
  **DG-1** (one presence ramp, one vocabulary).
- **Action:** developer adds the liveness annotation to the option label, sourced from the same `freshness`
  fact `nodePanelFacts` already carries; small; does not block the visual verdict. **Deferred.**

### DG-6 — the terminal-view has NO built UI and NO render; the whole on-screen surface is deferred (NEW, m38 / story-06) — **CLOSED 2026-07-23**

- **Observed (confirmed at source):** story 06 delivered the BACKEND only — relay bridge, in-memory mirror,
  read-only `/ws/terminal-view` route. There is **no `ui/` terminal-view component** (grep `terminal-view`
  in `ui/` = 0 matches; `Fleet.tsx` has no terminal reference). §Surface 3 is therefore authored from
  ADR-014 intent, **un-rendered** — a baseline with nothing on screen to judge against yet.
- **Why it matters:** an INCONCLUSIVE with no render is the honest verdict, but it must be CLOSED — skipping
  the render+judge leaves the read-only-in-fact (V2/V5), empty/rebuild-starts-empty (V7), multiplex (V8) and
  stream-ended (V9) claims **unwitnessed**, exactly the "confident CONFORMS on an unseen surface" trap
  §Correction 1 exists to prevent.
- **The correct answer (developer builds; designer judges):** build the on-screen terminal-view component,
  render it in the V7 / streaming / multiplex / ended states, and judge region-by-region against **V1–V9**.
- **Resolution:** closed at `aof:verify 38` via the task-03 `@manual` soak + a render pass handed to the
  designer. ~~**Deferred — the render is the missing input.**~~ — **CLOSED 2026-07-23.** The component was
  built (task 04) and five real renders were handed and judged across three passes; V1/V2/V3/V4/V6/V7/V9/
  V10/V11 and the multiplex header are now **witnessed**, three gaps were found and fixed against the pixels,
  and V5 + V8-at-byte-level + the collapsed default remain the honest residue. The lesson stands: **the
  render is what converts a checklist into a verdict** — and this milestone got the stronger form of it, a
  render that *changed the build three times*, corrected a rule (§Correction 3), and exposed an app-wide CSS
  bug no test had caught (DG-12).

### DG-7 — read-only legibility: absence-of-input is not self-evidently "read-only" (NEW, m38 / story-06, load-bearing-adjacent) — **DECIDED 2026-07-23**

- **Observed (structural, from ADR-014 + §Surface 3 intent — NOT a render verdict):** a terminal that
  renders live output but silently ignores keystrokes can be mistaken for a BROKEN interactive shell. V2
  pins that the read-only posture must be legible by an explicit marker, but the exact treatment (a `read-only`
  badge vs. a banner vs. a non-typeable cursor state vs. the view simply not accepting focus) is the open
  half of the rule.
- **Why it matters:** the worse-than-no-terminal lie — the operator believes they answered a `needs-input`
  prompt when nothing reached the worker (the whole reason V5 is the soak's central un-fakeable assertion).
- **The correct answer (designer owns it):** an explicit read-only affordance; **pick the treatment at the
  render, against V2.** — **PICKED 2026-07-23, at the render: a persistent quiet `read-only` pill in the
  stream-identity header (rendered even when the panel is collapsed), plus xterm `disableStdin` and NO input
  row at all (absent, not disabled).** Not a banner (too loud for a monitor), not a fake/greyed cursor
  (a promise of "coming soon"). Bound in **V12**; the pill is witnessed in all five renders.
- **Resolution:** a DESIGN.md rule picking the treatment **plus a `@uat` scenario** (a person tries to type,
  confirms the view says read-only, and confirms nothing reaches the worker). **Rule DECIDED; the `@uat`
  scenario remains owed at the soak.**

### DG-8 — the multiplex disclosure model is unpinned: how the fleet shows MORE than one worker terminal at once (NEW, m38 / story-06) — **DECIDED 2026-07-23**

- **Observed (structural):** ADR-014 routes by (nodeId, sessionId) and pins "opening an assignment card
  resolves its stream", and V8 pins the no-cross-wire invariant — but the DISCLOSURE model for N
  simultaneous streams (one-at-a-time per card vs. tabbed vs. a herdr-style multi-pane wall — RESEARCH
  §4.3/§4.5) is a design decision the backend does not settle.
- **Why it matters:** herdr's whole value is watching several workers at once; a one-at-a-time model may be
  honest but under-delivers the operator's stated end-state (STORY §Background).
- **The correct answer (designer owns it):** **pick the multiplex disclosure model** — per-card single
  stream for this story (with the multi-pane wall noted as future work), OR a wall now — and **state it, not
  leave it implicit.** — **PICKED 2026-07-23: per-card, one card = one stream, collapsed by default behind
  `Watch terminal →`, identity + `read-only` always on.** Bound as **V12**. N cards may be open at once
  (render B proves two side by side), so the operator can still watch several workers — but the board is not
  a wall by default. **The multi-pane wall is explicitly future work.**
- **Resolution:** a DESIGN.md rule + a `@uat` scenario (a person opens two workers' terminals and judges the
  presentation). **Rule DECIDED; the `@uat` scenario remains owed.**

### DG-9 — one open terminal inflates every sibling card in its grid row (NEW, m38 / story-06, from the pixels)

- **Observed (renders A/B/D/E/F):** the milestone cards sit in a stretched 3-column grid (the S9 rail:
  siblings match height so the row stays clean). Opening ONE terminal grows its card by ~250px, and the grid
  grows **every** card in that row with it — a card with no terminal (milestone 40) carries ~300px of dead
  white space in every capture.
- **Why it matters:** it is the S9 rail behaving as designed, but at a scale S9 never contemplated (S9
  budgeted for ONE extra text line, not a 192px viewport). At 2–3 open terminals per row the board becomes
  mostly whitespace, which erodes exactly the scan-ability the read-only monitor exists for.
- **Related, and already handled:** V11's constant-total-height clause keeps a stream *ending* from adding
  yet another reflow on top of this. The open/close reflow itself is unaddressed.
- **The correct answer (designer owns it):** decide between (a) accepting the stretch (simple, keeps row
  integrity — the current behaviour), (b) letting an open terminal card break the stretch (`items-start` on
  the grid, so siblings keep their natural height), or (c) promoting an opened stream out of the card grid
  entirely into a docked pane — which is the door to DG-8's multi-pane wall. **Judge it against a render of
  a board with ONE terminal open and several rows of cards**, which is not in the current set.
- **Resolution:** a DESIGN.md rule + a `@uat` scenario (a person opens one terminal on a full board and
  judges whether the board is still scannable). **Deferred.**

### DG-10 — the identity line spends its width on a raw session UUID (NEW, m38 / story-06, small)

- **Observed (renders A/B/D/E/F):** the header reads `38 → umamis-mac-mini · session 5f3c1e00-ab90-4d21-9f7a…`
  — the raw 36-char UUID consumes most of the identity line and still truncates mid-token, and it is the
  one part of the line that carries no discriminating power for a human (`38 → umamis-mac-mini` already
  identifies the stream uniquely on this board).
- **Why it matters:** V1 is satisfied (the stream IS named, and never by a raw id ALONE), so this is a
  polish finding, not a violation. But a mid-token ellipsis reads as "data was lost", and the noisiest text
  in the region is the least useful. It also competes for the header width that V11's chip vocabulary and
  V12's toggle both need.
- **The correct answer (designer owns it):** render the **short session** (`session 5f3c1e00`, the first
  segment — the same 8-char idiom the fixture and the mirror logs already use) and keep the FULL id in the
  existing `title` tooltip, which the component already sets. The human ref + node stay the primary
  identity.
- **Resolution:** developer changes `sessionLabel` in `ui/src/fleet/terminal-view/stream.mjs`; re-render.
  Small; does not block the verdict. **Deferred.**

### DG-11 — the work-item card's attention cluster truncates to `a…` (NEW, m38 / story-04 surface, from the story-06 pixels)

- **Observed (all renders, all three cards):** region 5's footer attention cluster renders as a single
  character plus an ellipsis — `a…` — beside the run/assignment chip. Whatever fact it is carrying is
  unreadable.
- **Why it matters:** a label truncated to one character is not a quiet label, it is noise: it costs layout
  width, draws the eye, and tells the operator nothing. §Surface 2 A8 pins the cluster as where the
  assignment ramp SPEAKS; here it says nothing.
- **The correct answer (designer owns it):** the cluster must either render a legible minimum (the chip's
  own label, wrapping or dropping the least-load-bearing element first) or **drop the element entirely**
  when it cannot render legibly — never a one-character stub. Same discipline as S6's "trailing truncation
  is acceptable" rail: truncation is acceptable **while the label is still readable.**
- **Note:** a **§Surface 2** finding seen incidentally in §Surface 3's renders; NOT part of the
  terminal-view verdict. May also be an artifact of the fixture's narrow footer content — confirm against a
  producer-fed, post-DG-12 render before acting. **Deferred.**
- **RE-SCOPED 2026-07-24, NOT closed.** Confirmed against the producer-fed, post-DG-12 render: the `a…`
  one-character stub **does not reproduce** — it was the fixture artifact this note suspected. But the defect it
  was pointing at **does** reproduce: **region 5 never names the assignment's target in full** (`→ umamis-m…`,
  `→ aaa-firs…` in every frame carrying a chip). The finding survives and moves to **DG-13** clause 5.
- **RE-OPENED 2026-07-24 (the DG-13/DG-14 re-render) — the "does not reproduce" line above is WRONG.**
  ~~"the `a…` one-character stub **does not reproduce** — it was the fixture artifact this note suspected"~~ —
  **FALSIFIED by real pixels.** The stub reproduces in the producer-fed, post-DG-12, real-assign re-render — at the
  **workspace-name** element rather than at the chip (`l…` / `le…` / `let…`, frames 04 / 04b / 05 / 06 / 07). It was
  never a fixture artifact; it was a narrow enough footer. **DG-11's own correct answer — *a legible minimum, or
  drop the element entirely; never a one-character stub* — was right all along and is STILL UNBUILT.** It is now
  carried, with a concrete fix, as **DG-16**.

### DG-12 — an unlayered CSS rule made EVERY button in the app ignore its own type classes (NEW 2026-07-23, app-wide, cross-milestone)

- **Observed (measured in the built bundle, found while root-causing GAP-2):** `ui/src/index.css` carried a
  hand-written **unlayered** `button,input,select,textarea{font:inherit}`. Tailwind v4 places all utilities
  in `@layer utilities`, and **unlayered CSS outranks any layer** — so every `<button>` in the app silently
  ignored its `text-*` and `font-*` classes and inherited the body type instead. Tailwind's preflight
  already ships the identical rule inside `@layer base`; the duplicate was deleted (not patched around).
- **Measured before → after:** terminal-view toggle 16px/400 → 11px/400 · `Assign →` 16px/400 → 11px/600 ·
  board `ActionsStrip` buttons 16px/400 → 14px/500 · `DetailPanel` tabs → 11px/600.
- **Why it matters to DESIGN, not just to CSS:** a design-conformance verdict is a claim about pixels, and
  **every verdict taken on a button-bearing surface before 2026-07-23 was taken under this bug.** The
  affected claims are specifically those about a control's **weight, size and relative prominence** —
  which is exactly what the fleet's "quiet, subordinate carve-out" rail (A2) is made of. Nothing here is
  *wrong* yet; it is *unverified*, and that must be said out loud rather than assumed away.
- **The debt, named honestly:**
  - **§Surface 1 (m38):** verdicts **STAND** — the current-work region is spans, not buttons. **Owed: one
    fresh 1280 frame** to confirm the region's relative prominence among now-correctly-typed neighbours
    (see the §Surface-1 debt note).
  - **§Surface 2 (m38):** already INCONCLUSIVE; the debt is sharper because **A2 is a rule about a button's
    weight**. Pre-fix impressions of `Assign →` are **void**; the owed render must be post-fix.
  - **§Surface 3 (m38):** unaffected — its only pre-fix button finding was GAP-2, which is what exposed the
    bug, and it has been re-rendered post-fix (renders E and F).
  - **Other milestones' surfaces** (board `ActionsStrip`, `DetailPanel` tabs, m25 chrome): **NOT m38's to
    re-judge.** Recorded here so the debt is not lost with this milestone.
- **The correct answer (designer owns it):** (a) treat this as the trigger for a **one-frame re-look of every
  surface with a binding rule about control weight**, tracked in the milestone that owns each surface; and
  (b) a standing rule — **global element resets belong in `@layer base`, never unlayered**, because
  unlayered CSS silently outranks the utility classes the design is written in.
- **Resolution:** a DESIGN.md rule (b, above) **plus a `@uat` visual-review pass** over the re-rendered
  surfaces. Not a code patch alone — the patch is already in; the *judgement* is what is owed. **Deferred to
  the owning milestones.**

### DG-13 — the affordance row goes ANONYMOUS under an error, and the row reflows on every label swap (NEW 2026-07-24, m38 / story-04, from the REAL-assign render) — **DECIDED**

- **Observed (real pixels, post-DG-12 build):** in the refused frame the picker (`flex-1 min-w-0 truncate`)
  collapses to a **bare chevron** — ~26px, down from ~284px — while the inline error takes the row. The
  operator cannot see which node is selected at the exact moment they must re-aim, and the error truncates
  before naming the holder (`Item "18" already has an active assignment …`). In the success frame the action
  narrows 67px → 44px on the `Sent` label swap and the picker absorbs the difference, so the row reflows on
  every state change. Region 5's chip target truncates in every frame that has one (**DG-11 re-scoped here**).
- **Why it matters:** A10's "rhythm" was written as a spacing idiom and read as one. These pixels show it is
  also **geometry** — and that a control which cannot name its target has lost the one thing A7's `Sent`
  claims to give "for free".
- **The correct answer (designer owns it): DECIDED — the five binding clauses in Amendment 2026-07-24 (b).**
  Fixed action width sized to `Assigning…`; a picker floor of ≥14ch + chevron that never yields; the message
  slot as the yielding element with the full text in `title`; copy priority **outcome > holder > all else**;
  and region 5's width priority **chip + `→ <target>` in full > `Open board →` > workspace name**.
- **Resolution:** a DESIGN.md rule (A10 amended + Amendment (b)) **plus** the §Surface 2 `@uat` scenario
  clause (e). Build-owed to story 04.

### DG-14 — a hung dispatch has no state, so the row wedges forever (NEW 2026-07-24, m38 / story-04, from F-38.04f) — **DECIDED**

- **Observed:** `runAssign` awaits with no timeout and only `sent` schedules a decay, so a POST that never
  answers holds `Assigning…` indefinitely — picker frozen, action disabled, message slot empty, no error —
  recoverable only by reloading the page. Reproduced by holding the request at the network layer.
- **Why it matters:** the States table had no row for it, so the surface's most confusing possible state was
  the one state the design never described. On a passively-refreshing monitor a frozen control reads as a
  broken page.
- **The correct answer (designer owns it): DECIDED — the six clauses in Amendment 2026-07-24 (b).** Timeout at
  **10s (2 × `POLL_MS`)** into the existing `refused` presentation, copy **`no answer — timed out`** (never
  "not sent" — a timed-out POST may have succeeded server-side), re-click permitted, and a late 2xx honoured
  only by A8's one silent re-load, never by resurrecting `Sent`.
- **Resolution:** a DESIGN.md rule (A7 amended + the new States row + Amendment (b)) **plus** the §Surface 2
  `@uat` scenario clause (d). Build-owed to story 04.
- **CLOSED 2026-07-24 (the DG-13/DG-14 re-render).** Frame `07-timed-out` witnesses clauses 1–4 in real pixels: a
  measured **10057 ms** timeout, the existing `refused` presentation reused verbatim (picker re-enabled on the same
  node, `Assign →` back in its primary tint, inline `destructive`), the copy **`no answer — timed out`**, and a
  resting state that permits re-click. The `title` reports the CALL only and names region 5 as the authority.
  **Clause 5 (a LATE 2xx must not resurrect `Sent`) is NOT ASSESSED** — the held POST was never answered.

### DG-15 — region 5: a long target OVERPRINTS `Open board →` (NEW 2026-07-24, m38 / story-04, from the DG-13/DG-14 re-render) — **BUILD DEFECT**

- **Observed (frames `08-long-target-chip-card.png` / `-page.png`, 1280, real minted record):** with the target
  `umamis-mac-mini-build-agent-02` the chip's `→ <target>` renders in FULL — DG-13 c5's headline demand, **met** —
  but it runs straight into `Open board →` with **no gap and no separator**: the target's trailing `2` and the `O`
  of `Open` occupy the same pixels, and the chip's `· just now` tail is destroyed outright. Neither the id's last
  glyph nor the action's first is cleanly readable. The workspace name **was** correctly dropped in this frame, so
  the drop half of c5 fired — and was **not enough**, because `Open board →` never yielded.
- **Expected vs observed.** Expected (DG-13 c5): a **yield order** — when the chip + target need the width,
  `Open board →` gives up space (it ranks below the chip+target and above the workspace name). Observed:
  `Open board →` keeps its full width and is **painted over**. A priority list was implemented as a *paint* order
  rather than a *yield* order.
- **Why it matters:** this is §Surface 3 **V11's lesson at a new address** — *chrome that destroys the content it
  annotates is worse than no chrome.* Here it destroys **both** parties: the target id (the very fact DG-13 c5
  exists to protect) **and** the card's own navigation affordance. And it fires exactly when the operator most
  needs to read the target — the moment a long-named node has just been assigned.
- **This is a BUILD DEFECT, not a rule that needs softening. The rule is right; it must NOT be amended to match
  the pixels.**
- **The concrete fix (developer):** region 5 is one flex row. Give every shrinkable child `min-w-0`; give the
  chip + `→ <target>` group the highest priority (`shrink-0`, or a basis that yields last); give `Open board →`
  `min-w-0 truncate` **plus an abbreviated form — `→` alone, with the full label in its native `title`** (the DG-10
  idiom); and drop the workspace name from the FLOW rather than truncating it (DG-16). **No element in region 5
  may be positioned outside the row's flow.**
- **The design rule this adds (designer owns it): DG-13 clause 5 gains a SIXTH clause — *no two elements in region
  5 may occupy the same pixels.* The priority list is a YIELD order, not a paint order: a lower-priority element
  gives up space (truncate → abbreviate → drop); it never stays put and gets overprinted.** Mirrors V11.
- **Resolution:** a DESIGN.md rule (the clause above) **plus** a §Surface 2 `@uat` visual-review clause — a person
  confirms a long node id **and** `Open board →` are both legible on one card. Build-owed to story 04.

### DG-16 — region 5: the workspace name yields to a ONE-CHARACTER STUB instead of being dropped (NEW 2026-07-24, m38 / story-04) — **BUILD DEFECT, and it RE-OPENS DG-11**

- **Observed (frames 04, 04b, 05, 06, 07):** whenever region 5 carries a chip, the mono workspace name
  `lark-guard-portal` renders as **`l…` / `le…` / `let…`** — one to three glyphs plus an ellipsis. Frame 08 shows
  the same element **dropped entirely** under heavier pressure, so the build has two behaviours and reaches for the
  worse one first. The sibling card's short name `aof` renders in full, which is why the defect shows only on the
  long one.
- **Expected vs observed.** Expected — **DG-11's already-recorded correct answer, verbatim:** *"the cluster must
  either render a legible minimum … or **drop the element entirely** when it cannot render legibly — never a
  one-character stub."* Plus DG-13 c5's *"the workspace name yields first."* Observed: it yields to a stub that
  spends ~20px of the row's scarcest resource and communicates **nothing**.
- **This falsifies DG-11's 2026-07-24 re-scope note**, which recorded the `a…` stub as a fixture artifact that
  *"does not reproduce."* **It reproduces** — in a producer-fed, post-DG-12, real-assign render, at the
  workspace-name element rather than the chip. See the correction appended to DG-11.
- **This is a BUILD DEFECT. DG-11's rule is right and must NOT be amended.**
- **The concrete fix (developer):** the workspace name renders **IN FULL or not at all** — never truncated. When it
  cannot render in full, remove it **and its `·` separator** from the flow (`hidden`, not `truncate`). It costs the
  operator nothing: the full workspace name is already carried, in full, by the WORKSPACES strip at the top of the
  same page.
- **The design rule (designer owns it): in region 5 the workspace name is the one element that is NEVER
  truncated — it renders in full or it is dropped.** Truncation is reserved for elements whose PREFIX still
  carries meaning; a workspace name's prefix does not.
- **Resolution:** a DESIGN.md rule (above) **plus** the §Surface 2 `@uat` clause. Build-owed to story 04.

### DG-17 — region 6: the refusal message STILL truncates before naming the holder (NEW 2026-07-24, m38 / story-04) — **the RULE is wrong against reality, not the build**

- **Observed (frames `06-refused-card.png` / `-page.png`):** the copy is exactly DG-13 c4's form —
  `already assigned → umamis-msi`, outcome first, no restatement of the ref — and the full sentence is carried in
  the element's `title`. But the slot is **136.94px** and the rendered text is **`already assigned → uma…`**. The
  **holder — the one fact no other region carries** — is still cut, which is the precise defect DG-13 was filed on.
- **The arithmetic shows the rule cannot be satisfied.** The row is 360.66px: picker floor 124.66 (DG-13 c2)
  + action 83.06 (DG-13 c1) + two 8px gaps = 223.72, leaving **136.94px** for the message. The rendered copy needs
  ~173px. **DG-13 c4's OWN exemplar — `already assigned → umamis-mac-mini` — needs ~197px.** The designer wrote a
  floor (c2), a fixed width (c1) and an exemplar copy (c4) that **cannot coexist in one 360.66px row** at 1280 in a
  two-column grid. **The developer implemented c4 exactly as written. This is the designer's error, and the rule is
  what changes.**
- **The tightened rule (designer owns it): the holder is an ATOMIC, PROTECTED substring — it renders in full or it
  is not shown at all. The message is a graduated copy LADDER, not one string handed to CSS `truncate`:**
  1. fits → `already assigned → <holder>`
  2. narrower → `held by <holder>`
  3. narrowest → `→ <holder>`
  4. if even (3) does not fit → the **outcome alone** (`already assigned`), the holder **omitted rather than
     mutilated**.
  The `title` always carries the whole sentence. CSS `truncate` remains only as a last-resort backstop, never the
  primary mechanism. **Rationale:** the `destructive` token plus the mere presence of a message already carries
  *"this was refused"*; the **holder** is the fact that must survive — and a three-glyph prefix of a node id is
  indistinguishable from three other node ids on the same roster, which is worse than saying nothing.
- **The timed-out leg needs no ladder and is witnessed correct:** `no answer — timed out` is 121.23px and renders
  in full (frame 07). The ladder is owed only where a node id is embedded in the copy.
- **Do NOT "fix" this by shrinking the picker floor.** DG-13 c2 exists because a picker that cannot name its
  target is the worse failure; c2 stands.
- **Resolution:** a DESIGN.md rule (DG-13 c4 superseded by the ladder above) **plus** the §Surface 2 `@uat` clause.
  Build-owed to story 04.

### DG-18 — a successful assign grows the card 6px and reflows its grid row (NEW 2026-07-24, m38 / story-04, small) — **DEFERRED**

- **Observed:** measured card height **251.5px** with no chip (frames 01, 02) → **257.5px** once region 5's
  `assigned` chip lands (frames 04 onward). In a stretched grid row every sibling card grows with it, so the board
  visibly jumps at the moment of the click.
- **Why it is recorded:** A10 binds the **row** (38px — and it conforms); **no rule binds region 5's height.** The
  milestone already polices this exact species elsewhere — **V11** (*"never costs the CARD height"*) and **DG-9**
  (*"one open terminal inflates every sibling card in its grid row"*). Story 04 did not create the growth — the 6px
  is the m35 chip pill's own geometry, region 5 carried forward verbatim — but **A8's one silent re-load moved the
  reflow to the moment of the click**, where the operator is looking, and made it deterministic rather than
  poll-phased.
- **The correct answer (designer owns it):** region 5's attention cluster **reserves the chip's line height whether
  or not a chip is present**, so a chip arriving never reflows the card or its row. One rule, region-5-local.
- **Scope, honestly:** this is m35 chip geometry as much as story-04's, and 6px is small. **Deferred** — recorded so
  it is not lost. It does **not** by itself move §Surface 2's verdict.

### DG-19 — region 5's yield order SQUEEZED where it must DROP (NEW 2026-07-24, third verdict) — **CLOSED at the fourth pass**

- **Observed:** at maximum pressure the LOWEST-priority element survived as an ellipsised fragment (`· just…`)
  while a HIGHER-priority one — `Open board`'s words — rendered zero glyphs; and the row's right edge sat ~8–10px
  past the card's content column, the pinned `→` having escaped its own box.
- **Root cause, measured:** the order was expressed as flex `shrink` factors. **A squeeze cannot express a
  terminal drop.** With a 1000:1 ratio the drill-in still yielded only 13.1px against the chip's 17.5px.
- **Rule (designer): each step of region 5's priority list is a DISCRETE budgeted drop, not a shrink factor.**
  An element that cannot render whole is removed from the flow with its separator; shrink factors remain only as
  a backstop. **CLOSED** — tail budget `REGION5_CHIP_SLOT_BUDGET_CH`, drill-in abbreviation
  `REGION5_DRILLIN_ABBREV_AT_CH`, and an explicit arrow-sized floor (`min-w-3.5`) that permits the shrink AND
  bounds it, so nothing escapes the card.

### DG-20 — the workspace name was gated on CHIP PRESENCE, not FIT (NEW 2026-07-24, third verdict) — **CLOSED, and WITNESSED**

- **Observed:** absence-of-name became an accidental second signal for "this card has an assignment", a fact the
  chip already states (A8's rail, in its quietest form).
- **Rule (designer): the gate is FIT.** The chip only applies the pressure; a derived budget decides.
- **CLOSED** — `REGION5_NAME_BUDGET_CH`, and the **discriminating frame was produced**
  (`09-DG20-short-name-with-chip`): a chip-bearing card whose name is `aof` KEEPS it, while `lark-guard-portal`
  is dropped. The two candidate gates had been observationally identical in all thirteen frames of two prior
  passes; they are not any more. **A second defect fell out of the same frame:** the kept name carried `flex-1`,
  so it GREW into the free space and squeezed the chip's target — the name outranking the target, which is c5
  backwards. It is now `shrink-0`; the fit budget already guarantees it is short.

### DG-21 — every rung of the refusal ladder must name the OUTCOME (NEW 2026-07-24, third verdict) — **CLOSED**

- **Observed:** DG-17's own middle rungs (`held by <holder>`, `→ <holder>`) carried no outcome word, so the row
  read `held by umamis-msi` in red beside region 5's `assigned → umamis-msi` and the picker's `umamis-msi` — the
  same node id three times, twice adjacent, with **only the colour** separating "someone else holds this" from
  "your assign succeeded". **A9/S4's rail — colour and label always travel together, never colour alone —
  broken by the designer's own copy.**
- **Rule (designer): the ladder drops the HOLDER, never the OUTCOME:** `<outcome> → <holder>` →
  `refused · <holder>` → `<outcome>` alone. **CLOSED** — witnessed as `refused · umamis-msi`, whole, at 115.47px.
- **Accepted residual (recorded, not deferred):** the rung does not say the node is the *holder* rather than the
  *refuser*. At 22ch there is no room for outcome + role; the `title` carries the whole sentence; under either
  reading the operator's next action is identical. Judge at `@uat` on the case still unrendered — a refusal whose
  holder differs from the picker's selection.

### DG-22 — the attention cluster drifted in the space the dropped name vacated (NEW 2026-07-24, fourth verdict) — **CLOSED**

- **Observed:** the `assigned` pill's left edge sat 7–58px in from the content edge, varying *inversely* with the
  chip's width — the signature of centring — so the footer's leading edge, the column the eye scans for "what
  state is this card in", moved card to card for a reason the reader cannot see, and made the drop look
  unjustified.
- **Rule (designer): the leading group is left-aligned; only the drill-in is right-aligned.** **CLOSED** — the
  cluster switches to `justify-between` exactly when the name is dropped.

### DG-23 — a separator renders with nothing on its left (NEW 2026-07-24, fourth verdict) — **DEFERRED**

- **Observed:** a lone `·` hugging `Open board →` on every chip-less card, reading as a bullet on the link.
- **Scope, honestly: this PREDATES story 04** — it is the m35 footer's placeholder idiom, named only now the
  louder findings are gone. With the row justified apart, whitespace already is the separator. **Deferred** —
  recorded so it is not lost; it does not move §Surface 2's verdict. *(Story 04 did fix the half it caused: the
  placeholder no longer renders ALONGSIDE a chip, which §2a's own rule already required.)*

## Documented defaults (decided here, not blocking)

1. **The session state is a label in the existing current-work region, not a new primitive.** `idle` /
   `running N run(s)` / `working · <repo> (session)` share one region, one slot, and the run-state ramp's
   two tokens. No session dot/chip/badge. Rationale: avoid a fourth confusable ramp; keep the fleet's
   three-ramp discipline intact.
2. **Reconciliation is PER-WORKSPACE.** A run subsumes **its own workspace's** session; sessions in other
   workspaces still render, on a second line, and the run line reads first.
   ~~"The run wins the line; `working · <repo> (session)` renders only when there is a live session AND no
   active run."~~ — **WRONG, corrected 2026-07-12; see §Correction 2.** That rule would hide real work.
3. **Working is `primary` — a peer of running.** Same emphasis; `idle` stays `muted`. The label, not the
   colour, distinguishes a run from a session. **(Witnessed, FRAME A.)**
4. **A session past TTL falls back to `idle`, never a stuck `working`** — even while its record is still on
   disk. The surface renders only what the aggregate hands it. **(Witnessed, FRAME C.)**
5. **All un-subsumed repos show on one comma-joined session line**, one `working ·` prefix, one trailing
   `(session)`, **alphabetical**; trailing truncation on a narrow card is acceptable.
6. **No new mock; the binding checklist is the conformance source of truth, judged against the CURRENT
   render of the surfaces production actually mounts** — §Surface 1a (web) and §Surface 1b (desktop),
   §Surface 2 (the story-04 assign affordance on the work-item card), and §Surface 3 (the story-06 read-only
   terminal-view).
   ~~"…judged against the current NodeCard render."~~ — **WRONG, corrected 2026-07-12; §Correction 1.**
7. **`NodeCard` is NOT a conformance surface.** Unreachable in every scope (§Correction 1); never again a
   baseline, never evidence that the surface is correct.
8. **ONE rule, N implementations, identical string** (S10). Duplication permitted; divergence is not.
   **Byte-identity is proven by a CONTRACT TEST, not by a screenshot** — that is the right instrument, and
   a pixel is not owed for it.
9. **A checklist must name the surface a user actually sees, and say which scope it governs.**
   (§Correction 1 is why this default exists.)
10. **A verdict is only as good as the states in frame.** A review that never saw `running` has not proven
    `working` is its peer; a review that never saw an expired session has not proven there is no stuck
    `working`. Unwitnessed states are recorded **NOT ASSESSED**, never assumed.
11. **The current-work region is capped at TWO lines by construction** — runs collapse to one line,
    sessions to one. The card may grow by one line and the grid stretches its siblings to match; it can
    **never** grow unboundedly with workspace count. If a future change would add a third line, that is a
    new design decision, not an implementation detail. **(§Correction 2, S9.)**
12. **The fleet stays a monitor; the assign affordance is a QUIET carve-out, not a new posture.** The
    read-only rail is not overturned by story 04 — it is carved out by exactly one affordance, which reads
    subordinate at rest (muted picker, low-emphasis primary action) and reuses the m35 assignment ramp for
    its result. No new colour/chip/toast for "assignable" or "just assigned." **(§Surface 2, A2/A8/A9.)**
    **Amended 2026-07-24 (F22):** a mutation must ANSWER AT THE POINT OF ACTION. The affordance may
    acknowledge the CALL — a transient `Sent` on its own control, `muted`, 5s, then gone — and the surface
    re-loads once on success so the m35 chip arrives promptly. That is not a second vocabulary: the
    affordance reports the call, region 5 reports the assignment. **(§Surface 2 Amendment 2026-07-24, A7/A8.)**
13. **The fleet terminal-VIEW is a READ carve-out, not a mutation — read-only IN FACT and IN LOOK.** The
    fleet face gains a server→browser terminal-VIEW (story 06 / ADR-014) but adds NO write path: NO input
    box, NO send control, NO type-into cursor (the input region is **absent, not disabled**). Read-write
    terminal control is Phase-2, out of scope. The bytes reuse the board terminal idiom (no fleet-local
    terminal vocabulary); the mirror is ephemeral, so empty-on-cold-start / rebuild-starts-empty is the
    NORMAL state, not an error, and a stream that ends reads as ended. **(§Surface 3, V2/V4/V5/V7/V9.)**
    **Witnessed 2026-07-23** in five real renders — the `read-only` label, the absent input row, the empty
    cold-start, the reused dock idiom and the honest terminal-state copy are no longer asserted, they are seen.
14. **The terminal-view is disclosed PER CARD, collapsed by default; its identity and `read-only` label are
    NOT.** One card = one stream, opened on request behind `Watch terminal →` (so no socket opens for a
    stream nobody watches), while the stream-identity header and the `read-only` marker render always — the
    posture is legible before the bytes are. The multi-pane wall is future work. **(§Surface 3 V12; resolves
    DG-7's treatment and DG-8's model.)**
15. **State messages are CHROME: they never overprint the output they describe, never grow the card, and
    the chip says the STATE while the bar says the REASON.** A message painted over the frozen frame
    destroys both facts; a bar that adds height reflows every sibling card in a stretched row at the moment
    a socket closes; a chip that grows into a sentence wraps the header and demotes the identity. And
    `waiting` may only be said while output is still possible — a perpetual `waiting for output` on a
    finished assignment is the same species of lie as a stuck `working`. **(§Surface 3 V10/V11, witnessed
    renders E and F.)**
16. **A design verdict is only as good as the stylesheet that produced it.** When a global style bug is
    found (DG-12: an unlayered `font:inherit` that made every `<button>` ignore its own type classes), every
    verdict taken under it is **named and re-looked**, not silently assumed to survive. The corollary rule:
    **global element resets belong in `@layer base`, never unlayered** — unlayered CSS outranks every
    Tailwind layer, so it silently beats the utility classes the design is written in. *(This is
    §Correction 1's lesson in a new register: a review is only as true as the thing it was pointed at.)*
17. **A terminal-view never mints assignment vocabulary — it speaks the m35 ramp's words.** Terminal-ness
    and wording both come from `assignmentChip(row)`, so `withdrawn`, `reclaimed` and `stale` inherit the
    right copy without a second list to maintain. **(§Correction 3, V10; A8's rail at a new address;
    witnessed render F.)**
18. **A silent success is a failure of the surface, not a virtue of it.** On a surface whose every other
    signal arrives by itself on a poll, "nothing changed" reads exactly like "nothing happened" — so a
    mutation must be acknowledged AT the action, and its durable confirmation must not wait for the next
    scheduled poll. The acknowledgment decays; the record persists. **(§Surface 2 A7/A8, Amendment
    2026-07-24; DG-4 decided; witnessed in the live soak, F22.)**

## Behavioural outcomes (cross-reference — NOT design)

The user-visible BEHAVIOUR is specified as task scenarios in the stories this milestone breaks down, NOT
here. This design fixes the look/feel; the features fix what happens.

- **Opening a coding assistant on a repo makes the node read `working · <repo>` within the heartbeat
  window; closing it returns the node to `idle`** (the `aof session start|ping|end` hook contract + TTL).
  The **TTL value, ping cadence and self-expiry timing** are behaviour/ARCHITECTURE, not design.
- **Presence aggregates active runs + live sessions across ALL of a node's registered workspaces**, with
  `work_dir` resolved **ABSOLUTE** (F11). Task-feature / ARCHITECTURE. The whole region is a lie without it.
- **The session↔run reconciliation rule** — decided in ARCHITECTURE; the design consumes its verdict
  (**per-workspace**, §Correction 2) and says how it reads.
- **The web and desktop projections agreeing byte-for-byte** — S10 is a design rule, but proving it is a
  **contract test**, not a screenshot: `test/arch/acd-captured-producer-fixture.test.mjs`. Green.
- **The repo list is sorted deterministically** (DG-2 / S6) — a small task-feature outcome in both
  projections.
- **The assign affordance's picker is producer-fed and its result closes the loop to the m35 chip** (story
  04; ADR-012 / ADR-008) — the DATA (roster options, minted record → chip) is proven by task 03's
  `@executable` over the real route/verb; the VISUAL fidelity is §Surface 2, judged at `aof:verify`.
- **The assign affordance acknowledges the call and re-loads on success** (story 04; §Surface 2 A7/A8,
  Amendment 2026-07-24 / F22) — the BEHAVIOUR is a task-feature outcome: on a 2xx the affordance holds a
  transient `Sent` state for one poll interval and the surface fires exactly ONE additional silent
  keep-last-good status re-load so the assignment record is read back immediately. **The wire contract does
  not change**; what changes is when the surface reads, and what it says while it waits. The VISUAL
  fidelity of both is §Surface 2, judged at `aof:verify` against the states named in the Amendment.
- **The picker annotates target liveness** (DG-5 / the open half of A6) — a small task-feature outcome on
  the option label.
- **The worker's live PTY streams cross-machine into the fleet terminal-view, routed by (nodeId, sessionId),
  and a fleet-side keystroke does NOT reach the worker** (story 06; ADR-014 / SECURITY T14) — the BEHAVIOUR
  (relay bridge over the frozen envelope, in-memory ephemeral mirror, read-only route, multiplex by
  (nodeId, sessionId), unresolvable-frame drop) is proven by tasks 00–02's `@executable` over the fake
  relay/PTY/mirror seams + the `acd-fleet-terminal-mirror-read-only` fitness; the VISUAL fidelity of the
  on-screen terminal-view is **§Surface 3**, judged **2026-07-23 — CONFORMS on all witnessed states** (see
  its Review status).
- **The terminal-view's empty-state copy is assignment-state aware, in the m35 ramp's own words** (V10) —
  a small task-feature outcome, WITNESSED render F: the view asks `assignmentChip(row)` whether the
  assignment is terminal (label `done`/`failed`) and, if so, reads `no live output — assignment <label>`
  (+ the chip's `· note`), in the BAR; the header chip reads the short `no live output`. **The stream
  resolution itself does NOT change** (tuple-only; never state-filtered), and there is **no hand-maintained
  list of terminal states** (§Correction 3).
- **A `@uat` visual-review scenario for the new region** — a person judges, on **both** surfaces (web +
  Rust desktop):
  1. a **running** node **beside** a working node (peer emphasis witnessed, not asserted);
  2. a **working-session** node (`working · <repo> (session)`);
  3. a **two-repo** node (one prefix, one qualifier, alphabetical);
  4. a **run + cross-workspace session** node (two lines, run first — the other workspace's session is
     **not** hidden);
  5. an **expired-session** node (falls back to `idle`, muted — no stuck `working`, no ghost).
  Hand this to the developer/product-owner as a candidate task `.feature`.
- **A `@uat` visual-review scenario for the assign affordance** (story 04; §Surface 2, DG-3/DG-4) — a person
  judges, on a **full board of milestone cards**: (a) the affordance reads as a quiet carve-out, not a
  control panel (A2 / DG-3 disclosure); (b) the empty-roster, one-node and many-node picker states (A4–A6);
  (c) assigning a real item and confirming the result is legible without re-checking (A7/A8 / DG-4) —
  **specifically: the click is answered AT the action (`Sent`, muted, ~5s), the m35 `assigned` chip appears
  in the footer without waiting for a visible pause, the row returns to rest with nothing left over, and a
  refused assign reads `destructive` inline with no `Sent`** (Amendment 2026-07-24 / F22); (d) **a HUNG
  dispatch answers within 10s with `no answer — timed out` and the row is usable again — it never wedges**
  (DG-14); (e) **the picker still names its target while an error is on screen** (DG-13).
  **Must be judged on a post-DG-12 build** — pre-fix pixels of `Assign →` are void.
- **A `@uat` visual-review scenario for the terminal-view** (story 06; §Surface 3, DG-7/DG-8) — a person
  judges: (a) the view NAMES its stream (V1) and reads as read-only, and a typed keystroke does NOT reach
  the worker (V2/V5 / DG-7); (b) the empty/cold-start and rebuild-starts-empty states are honest, not
  spinner-forever (V7); (c) two workers multiplexed, correctly labelled, no cross-wiring (V8 / DG-8); (d) a
  stream that ends reads as ended (V9). Hand this to the developer/product-owner as a candidate task
  `.feature`.
- **A `@uat` visual-review scenario for the terminal-view's DISCLOSURE and its state messages** (story 06;
  §Surface 3, V10/V11/V12, DG-9) — a person judges, on a **full board**: (a) at rest, with every panel
  collapsed, the board still reads as a MONITOR you can scan, and each collapsed panel still says whose
  stream it is and that it is read-only; (b) with one terminal open, the board is still scannable (DG-9);
  (c) on stream end, **both** the `stream ended` bar **and** the last output line are readable, and the card
  does not change height (V11); (d) a **done** and a **stale/reclaimed** assignment's view read
  `no live output — assignment …` in the m35 ramp's own words, not a perpetual `waiting for output` (V10 —
  witnessed render F; the `@uat` confirms it live). Hand this to the developer/product-owner as a candidate
  task `.feature`.
- **A `@uat` visual-review pass over every surface with a binding rule about CONTROL WEIGHT, re-rendered
  after the DG-12 CSS fix** — the fleet node card's neighbours (§Surface 1), the assign affordance
  (§Surface 2 / A2), and the board surfaces owned by other milestones (`ActionsStrip`, `DetailPanel` tabs).
  The patch is already in; the **judgement** is what is owed.
