# Run this on the Mac (umamis-mac-mini). Gathers the facts needed to confirm (or
# refute) whether the control node's global_workspace_descriptors.clone_url
# (ADR-010 Gap A extended) is visible on the worker's OWN local database, writes
# them to one file, and sends that file to the control node (win-host-a) over
# tailscale (`tailscale file cp`). Written during the milestone-38 live soak
# (2026-07-18) after the first cross-machine-registry-sync fix failed against
# the real worker and the operator asked for direct evidence rather than a
# second unverified guess.
