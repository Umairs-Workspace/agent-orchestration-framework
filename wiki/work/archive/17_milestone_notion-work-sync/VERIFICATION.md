# 17 · Notion Work-Board Sync — Verification

Verify run `2026-06-26` (`aof:verify 17`). Lanes in scope: `@executable` (56) + `@manual` (18); **no
`@uat`** (no human-acceptance step) and **no UI** (no design-conformance / designer pass). Outcome:
the automated + agent-runnable lanes are green; the live-Notion `@manual` lanes are **deferred** (no
workspace/token on this host) → milestone **held `in-review`** (operator decision).

## Verification evidence

Agent-run, no token required — each procedure executed inline against the as-built CLI.

- **`@executable` suite + fitness — green.** `node scripts/test.mjs` → **1310 ok / 0 not ok** (63 notion
  tests). The seven `acd-notion-*` arch-tests all pass (mutation-verified non-vacuous at the build-review
  gate). *verifies →* story-03 fitness table (mapping-sidecar, one-way, opt-in-no-op, auth-env-ref,
  no-schema-write, cli-not-mcp, fail-honestly) + every `@executable` scenario across stories 00/01/02.
- **Opt-in no-op, live.** `node src/cli.mjs work integrations notion sync-work 17 --json` against this
  unconfigured project returned `{ "configured": false, "items": [], "hint": "Notion sync is not
  configured. Add a \"work.integrations.notion\" block …" }`, exit 0, zero CLI spawn / zero Notion calls.
  *verifies →* `00/01_opt-in-no-op-when-unconfigured.feature` + arch-test `acd-notion-opt-in-noop`
  (ADR-004 / ADR-005 inv.3).
- **`aof project doctor` surfaces Notion, advisory-only.** `node src/cli.mjs project doctor` reported
  `warning: managed-tool — Run \`aof project provision notion\`…` (CLI absent → honest warning with
  provision guidance) and `ok: tool-platform — notion is supported on win32 (x64 only (no win32-arm64))`.
  Doctor exit 0 — no Notion check errored or threw. *verifies →* `02/03_doctor-surfaces-notion.feature`
  managed-tool absent-warning row + tool-platform win32-ok row + the never-error scenario.
- **Pinned `ntn` CLI installs and runs on win32 (binary availability).** `npx -y ntn@0.17.0 --version` →
  `ntn 0.17.0`, exit 0 — the descriptor's pinned version is provisionable via the npx lane and the binary
  executes on this win32 x64 host. *verifies →* `02/01_descriptor-registered.feature` (the live binary-run
  half) + the STATE §Open "win32 binary running" build-time `@manual` confirmation.

## Findings

| id | observed | type | severity | triage | routed-to | status |
|----|----------|------|----------|--------|-----------|--------|
| NTN-V1 | The four live-Notion `@manual` lanes — `01` live first-run create / resync-no-duplicate / patch-in-place, `02` live `ntn api` auth round-trip, `03` live doctor present-and-versioned + auth-reachable, `04` one-way disk-wins / no-read-back — could not be executed: this host has no Notion workspace and no `NOTION_API_TOKEN` (a known, documented constraint, RESEARCH §A2). Each lane has a **green `@executable` MECHANIC twin** proving the offline behaviour through the injected `ctx.notionSpawn` seam, and the structural invariants (one-way, fail-honestly, opt-in) are arch-test-enforced; the only unconfirmed surface is the real `ntn api` HTTP round-trip against a live board (auth landing, create/patch/relation actually written, 429/`Retry-After` pacing). | environmental (live-token deferral) | non-blocker | **defer** — run the live lanes against a real Notion board + token; sign off then. Not routed to a `@bug`: no defect observed, the behaviour is built and offline-proven. | live-token verify run (deferred) | open (deferred) |

## Accept decision

**Held `in-review` — NOT accepted** (operator decision, `2026-06-26`). The automated + agent-runnable
lanes are green and the validate gate passes (below), but the four live-Notion `@manual` lanes (NTN-V1)
remain unverified for want of a real workspace/token. The milestone's own STATE scopes these as "signed
off at verify with a real token"; absent the token, acceptance is deferred rather than asserted on the
offline twins alone. Stories 00–03 stay `in-review`; SPEC status stays `in-progress`.

**To accept later:** run the four NTN-V1 lanes against a live Notion board with `NOTION_API_TOKEN`
exported, record their results + sign-off here, then re-run `aof:verify 17` to flip the stories →
`done` and the milestone → `done` (and run the retrospective + `aof work memory ingest` at that close).

## Gate

`aof work validate 17` → **PASS — 17 is well-formed** (folder↔frontmatter, closed-vocab tags, depends
graph). Test-traceability + litmus carried by the green `@executable` suite and the build-review QA pass.

## Live verification + UAT sign-off (`2026-06-27`)

The NTN-V1 live lanes were finally run against a **real Notion board** (the operator's "Product Roadmap &
Objectives" data source) with a browser-logged-in `ntn`. **Outcome: UAT APPROVED — "all working"** (operator,
`2026-06-27`). But the live run exposed that the as-built apply layer was **non-functional** — every test had
stubbed the spawn, so a green `@executable` suite never touched real `ntn`. NTN-V1 is therefore **resolved
via a ground-up rebuild**, not a clean as-built confirmation. New finding **NTN-V2** captures the rebuild.

- **Evidence (live, observed on the board).** `323` / `326` / `330` (imported milestones) created as rows
  under the "Vendorco Regulatory Judge MVP" objective via the `Parent objective` relation; `333` +
  its 6 stories created as a nested tree (MVP → 333 → stories) in ONE sync run. Each row carries the mapped
  `Status` + a body rendered from the record-doc (`## Intent` / `## Scope`). A re-sync of byte-identical
  disk is a true noop (content-hash idempotency) — no duplicates.

| id | observed | type | severity | triage | routed-to | status |
|----|----------|------|----------|--------|-----------|--------|
| NTN-V1 | (see above) the four live-Notion `@manual` lanes were deferred for want of a token. | environmental | non-blocker | **RESOLVED** `2026-06-27` — live-verified + UAT-approved (after the NTN-V2 rebuild). | this section | **closed** |
| NTN-V2 | The live run found the milestone-17 apply layer built against a **fictional `ntn` CLI surface**: it spawned `ntn api pages create --data-source-id … --status-option … --relation-property …` (no such flags exist); the auth model **required** `NOTION_API_TOKEN` (wrong — `ntn` uses keychain `ntn login`, the env var is an optional override); and the Windows binary resolution spawned the `.cmd` shim (unspawnable; `shell:true` mangles the JSON body). Every `@executable` test stubbed the spawn, so the green suite proved nothing about the real egress. | defect (integration — never tested live) | **blocker** (the milestone's headline capability did not work) | **fix** (done `2026-06-27`) — rebuilt to the real `ntn api -X POST/PATCH v1/pages -d <json>` egress; keychain auth (TOKEN/KEYCHAIN modes); `node <pkg>/bin/ntn` launcher spawn; configurable `titleProperty`/`statusType`; page-body sync via `ntn pages edit`; in-run story nesting. The four `acd-notion-*` arch-tests rewritten to assert the REAL egress. Suite green (1387/0). | `src/notion/{cli,sync,projection,mapping}.mjs`, `notion-sync-work.mjs`, schema | **closed (fixed + live-verified)** |

**Process lesson (ADR-grade):** a green `@executable` suite that **stubs the one external seam** proves the
internal wiring and nothing about the integration. "No token → defer the live lane (@manual)" let the single
test that mattered — does this match the real tool? — never run, and the milestone shipped hollow. The
live/`@manual` integration check must be a **build-gate blocker**, not a deferrable lane, for any milestone
whose headline capability IS the external egress. (Folded to memory: [[notion-sync-rebuilt]].)

**Accept update (`2026-06-27`):** the NTN-V1 gate that held m17 `in-review` is resolved (live-verified +
UAT-approved). m17 is acceptable on the REBUILT apply layer — flip stories → `done` / SPEC → `done` at the
operator's word (the formal `aof:verify 17` accept + retrospective + `aof work memory ingest`).
