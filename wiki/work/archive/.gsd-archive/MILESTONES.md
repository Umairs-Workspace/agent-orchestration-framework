# Milestones: AOF

## v1.7 — Typed GSD SDK Backend

**Status:** Shipped 2026-05-17
**Started:** 2026-05-16
**Completed:** 2026-05-17
**Phases:** 33-38
**Plans:** 19
**Requirements:** 46/46 complete
**Audit:** Passed with accepted process debt

### Goal

Replace AOF's slash-command-based GSD integration with a typed adapter over `@gsd-build/sdk`, enforce explicit board↔milestone identity, and make board execution SDK-first while preserving runtime CLIs only for interactive fallback workflows.

### Delivered

1. Added a single typed GSD SDK adapter boundary with pinned `@gsd-build/sdk@0.1.0`, surface probing, typed state/roadmap/milestone calls, structured errors, injected tool paths, and dispatch logging.
2. Migrated board lifecycle and sync to explicit typed milestone binding through `aof boards sync <id> --milestone <id>`, with dry-run JSON, drift detection, v1.6 repair, and pending milestone surfacing.
3. Extracted the internal `BoardBackend` seam with GSD as the real backend and a null backend for tests, routing lifecycle and execution through backend capabilities.
4. Added captured SDK fixtures, the real SDK contract suite, SDK-path BDD siblings, v1.6 migration regression coverage, LF fingerprint stability, and PowerShell parity.
5. Replaced board assignment execution with SDK `runPhase()` results and demoted runtime CLI spawning to explicit fallback-only handling with loud stderr labels.
6. Added `aof boards doctor`, SDK/tools drift diagnostics, missing-tools checks, lock-state toolchain metadata, Windows environment warnings, and structured `--json` remediation hints.

### Progress

## v1.6 — Task Management

**Status:** Shipped 2026-05-15
**Started:** 2026-05-15
**Completed:** 2026-05-15
**Phases:** 28-32
**Requirements:** 30/30 complete
**Audit:** Passed with accepted process debt

### Goal

Add project-local kanban boards for deliverable-scoped task management, with GSD-backed milestone/phase synchronization, agent assignment, execution state, and a dedicated board UI.

### Delivered

1. Added file-backed `.aof/boards/<id>/BOARD.json` board state, task files, validation, and generated board index/cache.
2. Added objective breakdown and proposal application for board tasks using GSD planning semantics.
3. Added phase-linked task assignment and execution records with GSD ceremony command tracking.
4. Added a separate `aof boards ui` surface with kanban columns, board navigation, progress visibility, and GSD sync/repair actions.
5. Hardened GSD-backed board lifecycle: board objectives are mandatory, manual task creation is blocked until GSD sync rules are satisfied, and sync no longer imports the active roadmap implicitly.
6. Added CLI-only board cleanup through `aof boards remove <id>` with `--dry-run`.
7. Added supply-chain safety defaults and lockfile audit checks for the new UI dependency surface.

### Progress

- Phase 28: Board And Task State Foundation — complete 2026-05-15.
- Phase 29: GSD Objective Breakdown — complete 2026-05-15.
- Phase 30: Agent Assignment And Execution — complete 2026-05-15.
- Phase 31: Kanban Setup UI — complete 2026-05-15.
- Phase 32: Task Management Verification — complete 2026-05-15.

## v1 — Assistant Configuration Foundation

**Status:** Shipped 2026-05-07
**Phases:** 1-5
**Plans:** 15
**Requirements:** 32/32 complete
**Audit:** Passed

### Delivered

AOF now lets users define assistant-facing assets once in `.aof/`, render them to Claude Code and Codex, manage lock state and GSD install intent, edit configuration through the setup UI, and verify the full v1 behavior through unit, BDD, smoke, and UI build checks.

### Key Accomplishments

1. Established `.aof/` as the repo-local source of truth for configuration, source assets, runtime overrides, and lock state.
2. Added runtime rendering, dry-run planning, drift protection, stale pruning, deterministic Codex rule merging, and lock replay behavior.
3. Added automation-friendly CLI inspection/install flows plus interactive setup selection and GSD package intent handling.
4. Reworked the setup UI into a `.aof` configuration editor with runtime capability visibility and config-only execution boundaries.
5. Hardened diagnostics, setup UI request/static handling, cross-platform smoke coverage, and closeout verification.

## v1.4 — Namespaced CLI Contract

**Status:** Complete
**Started:** 2026-05-10
**Phases:** 18-22
**Requirements:** 22/22 complete

### Goal

Redesign AOF's CLI around durable product-area namespaces, review every command contract explicitly, remove legacy command ambiguity, and harden the rewritten CLI against live repository workflows.

### Planned Scope

1. Review every current command and subcommand before implementation.
2. Replace overloaded top-level asset commands with `aof assets ...`.
3. Replace GSD install flows with `aof packages ...`.
4. Keep `aof init` top-level and limited to project workspace initialization.
5. Remove legacy aliases instead of preserving deprecated command paths.
6. Validate the final command surface through live repository workflows and BDD coverage.

### Progress

- Phase 18: Command Contract Audit — complete 2026-05-10.
- Phase 19: Assets Namespace Rewrite — complete 2026-05-10.
- Phase 20: Packages Namespace Rewrite — complete 2026-05-10.
- Phase 21: Project And Diagnostics Commands — complete 2026-05-11.
- Phase 22: Live Repository Verification — complete 2026-05-11.

### Delivered So Far

1. Completed a command-by-command audit and accepted the namespaced command contract.
2. Replaced asset source commands with `aof assets add/list/show/remove/use/unuse`.
3. Replaced asset rendering, validation, cleanup, and editor launch with `aof assets apply/validate/clean/ui`.
4. Removed old `add`, `global`, `apply`, `sync`, `clean`, and `install` execution paths with replacement guidance and no side effects.
5. Updated BDD, README, help output, and planning artifacts for the assets namespace.
6. Replaced GSD install flows with `aof packages add/list/show/remove/validate/install`.
7. Preserved explicit network/package-code boundaries for package installer execution and moved lock replay to `aof packages install --from-lock`.
8. Moved project inspection, validation, diagnostics, and migration to `aof project show/validate/doctor/migrate`.
9. Kept `aof init` as the only top-level product command and removed init-time guided/default asset creation.
10. Removed old `validate`, `doctor`, `migrate`, `config`, and `catalog` execution paths with no-side-effect guidance.
11. Hardened live repo workflows with friendlier CLI output, source-only init guidance, generated-output `.gitignore` files, setup UI cleanup, command/skill additional files, runtime path placeholders, and associated-file validation.

## v1.5 — Runtime Semantics And Workflow Assets

**Status:** Shipped 2026-05-14
**Started:** 2026-05-11
**Completed:** 2026-05-14
**Phases:** 23-27
**Requirements:** 24/24 complete
**Audit:** Passed

### Goal

Align AOF's Claude/Codex adapter semantics with real runtime capabilities and introduce optional workflow-backed assets for shared process logic with runtime-specific wrappers.

### Planned Scope

1. Make Claude the only runtime that renders command assets; reject Codex command targets with clear diagnostics.
2. Preserve simple direct asset authoring while disallowing argument handling in simple mode.
3. Add optional workflow assets that render shared process files per runtime.
4. Add runtime-aware `{{skills.<id>}}` and `{{workflows.<id>}}` placeholders with validation.
5. Update setup UI authoring so users choose Simple or Workflow-backed mode and only workflow-backed assets expose arguments.
6. Verify with BDD and live GSD-style examples where Claude commands and Codex skills share workflow files.

### Delivered

1. Reconciled command semantics with real runtimes: Claude commands render to `.claude/commands/*`; Codex command targets are rejected.
2. Preserved simple direct assets while blocking argument metadata and argument-looking content outside workflow-backed mode.
3. Added first-class workflow assets rendered under `.claude/aof/workflows/` and `.codex/aof/workflows/`.
4. Added workflow-backed Claude command and Codex skill wrappers with runtime-appropriate argument guidance.
5. Added validated `{{skills.*}}` and `{{workflows.*}}` runtime path placeholders across resources, overrides, workflows, and referenced globals.
6. Updated setup UI authoring with Simple / Workflow-backed modes, argument controls, unsupported runtime disabling, and reference insertion.
7. Verified the milestone through Node BDD, PowerShell BDD parity, UI build checks, repo check, and live GSD-style UAT.

### Progress

- Phase 23: Runtime Capability Contract — complete 2026-05-12.
- Phase 24: Workflow Asset Model — complete 2026-05-14.
- Phase 25: Asset Reference Placeholders — complete 2026-05-14.
- Phase 26: Workflow-Backed Setup UI — complete 2026-05-14.
