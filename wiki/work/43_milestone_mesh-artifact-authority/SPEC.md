# 43 · Mesh artifact authority — the cache is the read surface

## Objective

A work item worked by a worker node is currently readable on the control node only by accident,
and only for a while. This milestone makes the control node's SQLite cache the **one read
surface** for work-item state and artifact content, fed by whichever node authored the change,
and makes an assigned item **exclusively owned** for the duration of its phase.

The measured disease is not staleness — it is staleness that is *actively republished over live
truth on a timer*:

| The mechanic | Where |
|---|---|
| The worker streams its worktree state while a run is live | [mesh-launcher.mjs:1448](../../../src/mesh-launcher.mjs#L1448) |
| …but only **four** files ride the wire: `SPEC.md`, `STORY.md`, `VERIFICATION.md`, `RETROSPECTIVE.md` | `WORK_ITEM_DOC_FILES`, [global-work-store.mjs:17](../../../src/global-work-store.mjs#L17) |
| …and never `tasks/*.feature` — *"the features live in the worker's worktree and are not streamed yet"* | [tasks.mjs:15](../../../src/commands/tasks.mjs#L15) |
| The control launcher republishes the workspace on a cadence | [mesh-launcher.mjs:732](../../../src/mesh-launcher.mjs#L732) |
| …which **wholesale-deletes `work_items` and rebuilds it from the control's own disk** | [global-work-store.mjs:431](../../../src/global-work-store.mjs#L431), [:417](../../../src/global-work-store.mjs#L417) |
| On a successful push the worker deletes its worktree | [mesh-worker-execution.mjs:2664](../../../src/mesh-worker-execution.mjs#L2664) |

While a run is live the two writers alternate and the last tick wins. After settle the worker
never ticks again, so the control's stale disk wins **permanently** — the item reverts to its
pre-run scaffold with the work invisible on a branch nothing on the control node ever fetches
(the only `git fetch` in `src/` is worker-side worktree construction,
[mesh-worktree.mjs:155](../../../src/mesh-worktree.mjs#L155)).

Only five commands consult the worker's view at all (`list`, `doc`, `run-status`, `continue`, and
`tasks` for existence). `next` is `nextWork(ws.workDir, scope)` — pure disk
([next.mjs:25](../../../src/commands/next.mjs#L25)) — as are `validate`, `doctor`, `find`, the
graph verbs, and `resolve.mjs`, which most read commands sit on.

**The end state:** every reader answers from the cache; every writer — worker *or* control —
publishes into it; an item under assignment cannot be written by anyone else; and nothing is
silently overwritten by a checkout that never ran the work.

## Scope

In scope:

- **The exclusive item lock** — an active assignment locks the item at *execution scope*, against
  a second assignment, against a local run mint, and against control-side mutation. Operator
  decision (2026-08-01): control-side changes are refused while a phase is in flight and allowed
  only at a **gate** (no active assignment), which is also the only safe moment for an insert.
- **Write-triggered artifact sync** — a Claude Code `PostToolUse` hook makes the worker report
  each artifact write as it happens, rather than being discovered by a periodic re-scan. The
  streamed file set widens from the four-name whitelist to every artifact a reader needs
  (`tasks/*.feature`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `RESEARCH.md`, `STATE.md`, ADRs).
- **The cache as the read surface** — `work_items` and the artifact tables stop being rebuilt
  from control disk; readers move off `listItems`/`findWork`/`nextWork` onto the cache; the
  control node publishes its own lifecycle writes through the same seam every other node uses.
- **Staleness, never eviction** — cached rows carry `syncedAt` + the reporting node; past the
  window they are marked stale, never deleted. The board renders a stale badge and a **Resync**
  action that requests a fresh push from the owning node.
- **Gate-time propagation, control → worker** — a dispatch brings the item's existing branch up to
  the directive's pinned base commit before the agent starts, so a control-side edit made at a
  gate reaches a *continuing* item.

Out of scope:

- **Concurrent workers on one item** — explicitly deferred (operator, 2026-08-01). The lock's
  whole premise is one holder; multi-holder arbitration is a later milestone if ever.
- **Reading git for artifacts.** The cache is fed by the wire, not by fetching branches. Git stays
  the transport for *structure* (the branch, the base-commit pin) and the durable history of the
  work; it is never a read path for item state.
- **Landing run-settled docs on the default branch** (m42's open branch-cure row) — **superseded**.
  It existed to make the control's disk current for disk-based readers; this milestone removes the
  disk-based readers instead. See [42's ROADMAP](../42_structural-overhaul/ROADMAP.md).
- **Structural operations moving off disk.** `work-reindex` renames real folders, `validate`/`doctor`
  check folder↔frontmatter *consistency*, `work-upgrade` rewrites templates in place — the disk is
  the subject of those operations, not a stale copy of a fact. They stay local, and each publishes
  its result into the cache.

## Stories

<!-- Populated at the Break-down stage (refine). -->

Six stories (ADR-009). The PO's five candidates stand, with ONE architect correction: the original
`cache-read-surface` **split in two** along the authority cut (the ~3-module write-side change) vs. the
reader migration (the 18-site read-side sweep) — keeping them together made the critical path as long as
the widest mechanical sweep and the risky change unreviewable inside a 13-module diff.

- [x] `01_story_item-lock` — an assignment exclusively owns its item at execution scope; a second
      assignment, a local run mint and a control-side mutation are all refused, coded and loud, until
      the next gate. (ADR-003)
- [x] `02_story_cache-authority` — `work_items` stops being rebuilt from control disk and becomes an
      upserted, provenance-stamped **fact** behind ONE seam both the control node and every worker
      write through, with author-retraction deletion. **Also carries schema v8's guarded `ALTER` and the
      write-side provenance stamping** (moved here from story 04 at refine — ADR-010 R-D2). (ADR-004)
- [x] `03_story_artifact-sync-on-write` — the `PostToolUse` hook, the derivation-free enqueue, the
      `.claude/settings.json` **merge** (never wholesale), the widened artifact manifest, and the
      daemon-side batched drain on the existing tick. (ADR-001, ADR-002, ADR-007)
- [x] `04_story_staleness-and-resync` — everything **read-side** from the v8 columns down: the shared
      staleness predicate, the wire envelope (`syncedAt` / `reportedBy` / `stalenessSeconds`), the
      never-evict rule, and the board's stale badge + Resync action. Also carries three substrates the
      repo does not have yet — a board headless mount harness, the `work:resync` transport, and a
      `Board.tsx`-root 1s clock. (ADR-006, ADR-010 R4, DESIGN.md)
- [x] `05_story_gate-propagation` — the dispatch advances an existing item branch to the pinned base
      commit at the worker's reuse door, never discarding a worker commit. (ADR-008)
- [x] `06_story_cache-read-surface` — the cache-first read seam and the staged reader migration,
      chokepoint-first through `commands/resolve.mjs`, with the worker-side and structural readers
      pinned to disk, and doctor's status overlay. (ADR-005)

**Build order** — wave 1 (parallel): `01` ∥ `02`, the two risk-carrying cores. Wave 2 (parallel):
`03` ∥ `04` ∥ `05`, each depending on wave 1 and on no wave-2 sibling. Wave 3: `06`, last on purpose —
it is the widest and most mechanical change, and it is only *correct* once the cache is authoritative
and provenance-stamped.

Three conditions on that order, established by the Three Amigos at refine and not optional:

1. **Wave 1 is parallel only if story 01's control-side-mutation guard lands in
   `effects/stream-transitions.mjs`** (`transitionStreamReindexed`), not in story 02's upsert seam.
   Routing it through the seam serialises `01` behind `02`.
2. **Story 04's three missing substrates should be started during wave 1** — the board mount harness
   (~1.5–2.5 days), the `work:resync` transport (~2 days), and the `Board.tsx`-root clock. They are
   ~4 days of work under 79 scenarios and are the milestone's real critical path, not the cache cut.
3. **`src/mesh-launcher.mjs` is the concentration point, not `mesh-worker-execution.mjs`** — four of the
   six stories touch it (`02`, `03`, `06`, and `04` if it hosts Resync). ADR-009's claim that
   `artifact-sync` shares only a new leaf with the cache work is false: ADR-007 re-exports the derived
   `WORK_ITEM_DOC_FILES` from `global-work-store.mjs`, which `02`, `03` and `04` all edit. Sequence the
   textual overlap rather than assuming it away.

## Dependencies

- **42 · Structural overhaul** — this milestone is built on wave (d)'s seams and would be
  unimplementable without them: the effects ledger and its four transition seams own the
  cascades this work declares; `transitionRunStart` is the single mint door the lock hangs on;
  `effects/stores.mjs`'s fact/projection classification is the thing being *revised* (the streamed
  mirrors were already classified facts — `work_items` is the projection that must stop being
  rebuilt from disk); and the **base-commit pin** (`50c2c82`) is the control→worker propagation
  mechanism the gate story extends.
- **The item-branch derivation** (`87a7f39`) — `aof/mesh/<ref>` is the branch the gate story
  fast-forwards; without one derivable branch per item there is no stable line to advance.
